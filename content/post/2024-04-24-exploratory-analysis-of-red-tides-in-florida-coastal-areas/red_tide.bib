  abstract = {Data collected along the southwest coast of Florida between Tampa Bay and Sanibel Island on the abundance of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis from 1954 to 2002 were examined for spatial and temporal patterns. K. brevis was found to be approximately 20-fold more abundant within 5km of the shoreline than 20--30km offshore. Overall, K. brevis was approximately 13--18-fold more abundant in 1994--2002 than in 1954--1963. In 1954--1963, K. brevis occurred primarily in the fall months. In 1994--2002, it was more abundant not only in the fall, but also in the winter and spring months. It is hypothesized that greater nutrient availability in the ecosystem is the most likely cause of this increase in K. brevis biomass, and the large increase in the human population and its activities in South Florida over the past half century is a major factor.},

  abstract = {Karenia is a genus containing at least 12 species of marine unarmored dinoflagellates. Species of the genus can be found throughout the world in both oceanic and coastal waters. They are usually sparse in abundance, but occasionally form large blooms in coastal waters. Most Karenia species produce a variety of toxins that can kill fish and other marine organisms when they bloom. In addition to toxicity, some Karenia blooms cause animal mortalities through the generation of anoxia. At least one species, Karenia brevis, produces brevetoxin that not only kills fish, marine mammals, and other animals, but also causes neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and respiratory distress in humans. The lipid soluble brevetoxin can biomagnify up the food chain through fish to top carnivores like dolphins, killing them. Karenia dinoflagellates grow slowly so physical concentrating mechanisms are probably important for the development of blooms. The blooms are highly sporadic in both time and space, although most tend to occur in summer or fall months in frontal regions. At the present time, our understanding of the causes of the blooms and ability to predict them is poor. Given the recent discovery of new species, it is likely that more Karenia species and toxins will be discovered in the future.},

  abstract = {With over 50\% of the US population living in coastal counties, the ocean and coastal environments have substantial impacts on coastal communities. While may of the impacts are positive, such as tourism and recreation opportunities, there are also negative impacts, such as exposure to harmful algal blooms (HABs) and water borne pathogens. Recent advances in environmental monitoring and weather prediction may allow us to forecast these potential adverse effects and thus mitigate the negative impact from coastal environmental threats., One example of the need to mitigate adverse environmental impacts occurs on Florida's west coast, which experiences annual blooms, or periods of exuberant growth, of the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis. K. brevis produces a suite of potent neurotoxins called brevetoxins. Wind and wave action can break up the cells, releasing toxin that can then become part of the marine aerosol or sea spray. Brevetoxins in the aerosol cause respiratory irritation in people who inhale it. In addition, asthmatics who inhale the toxins report increase upper and lower airway lower symptoms and experience measurable changes in pulmonary function. Real-time reporting of the presence or absence of these toxic aerosols will allow asthmatics and local coastal residents to make informed decisions about their personal exposures, thus adding to their quality of life., A system to protect public health that combines information collected by an Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) has been designed and implemented in Sarasota and Manatee Counties, Florida. This system is based on real-time reports from lifeguards at the eight public beaches. The lifeguards provide periodic subjective reports of the amount of dead fish on the beach, apparent level of respiratory irritation among beach-goers, water color, wind direction, surf condition, and the beach warning flag they are flying., A key component in the design of the observing system was an easy reporting pathway for the lifeguards to minimize the amount of time away from their primary duties. Specifically, we provided a Personal Digital Assistant for each of the eight beaches. The portable unit allows the lifeguards to report from their guard tower. The data are transferred via wireless Internet to a website hosted on the Mote Marine Laboratory Sarasota Operations of the Coastal Ocean Observation Laboratories (SO COOL) server., The system has proven to be robust and well received by the public. The system has reported variability from beach to beach and has provided vital information to users to minimize their exposure to toxic marine aerosols.},

  abstract = {As recently as a decade ago, Karenia brevis red tides and their effects on animal resources in the Gulf of Mexico were principally perceived as acute blooms that caused massive fish kills. Although occasional mortalities of higher vertebrates were documented, it has only been in the past decade that conclusive evidence has unequivocally demonstrated that red tides and their brevetoxins are lethal to these organisms. Brevetoxins can be transferred through the food chain and are accumulated in or transferred by biota at many trophic levels. The trophic transfer of brevetoxins in the food web is a complex phenomenon, one that is far more complicated than originally conceived. Unexplained fish kills and other animal mortalities in areas where red tide is endemic are being increasingly linked with post-bloom exposures of biota to brevetoxins. Mass mortality events of endangered Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) follow a consistent spatial and temporal pattern, occurring primarily in the spring in southwestern Florida. Persistent blooms can also cause a cascade of environmental changes, affecting the ecosystem and causing widespread die-offs of benthic communities. Ongoing fish kills from sustained blooms can lead to short-term declines in local populations. Although animal populations in areas where red tide is endemic are unquestionably at risk, it remains to be determined to what extent populations can continue to recover from these sustained effects.},

  abstract = {The red tide dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (Davis) G. Hansen and Moestrup is noted for causing mass mortalities of marine organisms in the Gulf of Mexico. Most research has focused on culture isolates from the eastern Gulf of Mexico. In this investigation, we examine the effects of light, temperature and salinity on the growth rate of K. brevis from the western Gulf of Mexico. Growth rates of K. brevis were determined under various combinations of irradiance (19, 31, 52, 67, and 123 mmol m 2 s 1), salinity (25, 30, 35, 40 and 45), and temperature (15, 20, 25, and 30 8C). Maximum growth rates varied from 0.17 to 0.36 div day 1 with exponential growth rates increasing with increasing irradiance. Little or no growth was supported at 19 mmol photons m 2 s 1 for any experiment. Maximum growth rates at 15 8C were much lower than at other temperatures. Maximum growth rates of the Texas clone (SP3) fell within the range of Florida clones reported in the literature (0.17--0.36 div day 1 versus 0.2--1.0 div day 1). The Texas clone SP3 had a very similar light saturation point compared to that of a Florida isolate (Wilson's clone) (67 mmol m 2 s 1 versus 65 mmol m 2 s 1), and light compensation (20--30 mmol m 2 s 11). The upper and lower salinity tolerance of the Texas clone was similar than that of some Florida clones (45 versus 46 and 25 versus 22.5, respectively). In our study, the Texas clone had the same temperature tolerance reported for Florida clones (15--30 8C). While individual clones can vary considerably in maximum growth rates, our results indicate only minor differences exist between the Texas and Florida strains of K. brevis in their temperature and salinity tolerance for growth. While the literature notes lower salinity occurrences of K. brevis in nearby Louisiana, our isolate from the southern Texas coast has the higher salinity requirements typical of K. brevis in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.},

  abstract = {Research on Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico started with the 1946--1947 red tide along the Florida west coast. Early research was on the organism itself, its tolerances and requirements, and the environment in which it lived and grew. Control of blooms, as a management option, was pursued in the 1950s with little success. However, in the 1960s--1970s, new regulation of shellfish growing areas was a public health management success. Research on K. brevis blooms followed funding cycles and was sporadic until the late 1990s when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funded the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (ECOHAB) and NOAA Monitoring and Event Response of Harmful Algal Blooms (MERHAB) programs. These particular funding programs, augmented by State of Florida appropriations, provided the opportunity to study K. brevis blooms on different temporal-spatial scales and consequently advanced the science. This review looks at historical research results in the light of today's advances.},

  abstract = {Nearly all annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (K. brevis) pose a serious threat to coastal Southwest Florida. These blooms discolor water, kill fish and marine mammals, contaminate shellfish, cause mild to severe respiratory irritation, and discourage tourism and recreational activities, leading to significant health and economic impacts in affected communities. Despite these issues, we still lack standard measures suitable for assessing bloom severity or for evaluating the efficacy of modeling efforts simulating bloom initiation and intensity. In this study, historical cell count observations along the southwest Florida shoreline from 1953 to 2019 were used to develop monthly and annual bloom severity indices (BSI). Similarly, respiratory irritation observations routinely reported in Sarasota and Manatee Counties from 2006 to 2019 were used to construct a respiratory irritation index (RI). Both BSI and RI consider spatial extent and temporal evolution of the bloom, and can be updated routinely and used as objective criteria to aid future socioeconomic and scientific studies of K. brevis. These indices can also be used to help managers and decision makers both evaluate the risks along the coast during events and design systems to better respond to and mitigate bloom impacts. Before 1995, sampling was done largely in response to reports of discolored water, fish kills, or respiratory irritation. During this timeframe, lack of sampling during the fall, when blooms typically occur, generally coincided with periods of more frequent-than-usual offshore winds. Consequently, some blooms may have been undetected or under-sampled. As a result, the BSIs before 1995 were likely underestimated and cannot be viewed as accurately as those after 1995. Anomalies in the frequency of onshore wind can also largely account for the discrepancies between BSI and RI during the period from 2006 to 2019. These findings highlighted the importance of onshore wind anomalies when predicting respiratory irritation impacts along beaches.},

  abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis on the West Florida Shelf have become a nearly annual occurrence causing widespread ecological and economic harm. Effects range from minor respiratory irritation and localized fish kills to large-scale and long-term events causing massive mortalities to marine organisms. Reports of hypoxia on the shelf have been infrequent; however, there have been some indications that some HABs have been associated with localized hypoxia. We examined oceanographic data from 2004 to 2019 across the West Florida Shelf to determine the frequency of hypoxia and to assess its association with known HABs. Hypoxia was present in 5 of the 16 years examined and was always found shoreward of the 50-meter bathymetry line. There were 2 clusters of recurrent hypoxia: midshelf off the Big Bend coast and near the southwest Florida coast. We identified 3 hypoxic events that were characterized by multiple conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) casts and occurred concurrently with extreme HABs in 2005, 2014, and 2018. These HAB-hypoxia events occurred when K. brevis blooms initiated in early summer months and persisted into the fall likely driven by increased biological oxygen demand from decaying algal biomass and reduced water column ventilation due to stratification. There were also four years, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, with low dissolved oxygen located near the shelf break that were likely associated with upwelling of deeper Gulf of Mexico water onto the shelf. We had difficulty in assessing the spatiotemporal extent of these events due to limited data availability and potentially unobserved hypoxia due to the inconsistent difference between the bottom of the CTD cast and the seafloor. While we cannot unequivocally explain the association between extreme HABs and hypoxia on the West Florida Shelf, there is sufficient evidence to suggest a causal linkage between them.},

  abstract = {This contribution represents a review of the historical and recent literature describing the environmental factors that relate to the distribution, growth, primary production, nutrient requirements and utilization along with hypotheses that are extant for the initiation, growth, maintenance and termination of Karenia brevis blooms on the West Florida Shelf. Potential nutrient sources that support blooms and relate to recent questions on the duration, frequency, and intensity of WFS blooms are summarized and some thoughts are presented which relate to the question of why K. brevis, a slow growing dinoflagellate, becomes dominant in a nearshore shelf region that is typically dominated by diatoms. There is no single hypothesis that can account for blooms of K. brevis along the west coast of Florida. Of the approximately 24 thoughts and hypotheses described herein (including the 1880s speculation), seven are related to rainfall and/or riverine flux, six invoke the benthos or bottom flux in one form or another, seven involve water column hydrodynamics or are unrelated to the benthos or land sources, and four are primarily chemical/allelopathy based. Nutrient sources for growth and maintenance range from atmospheric deposition, N-fixation, riverine and benthic flux, and zooplankton excretion to decaying fish killed by the toxic dinoflagellate with no one source being conclusively identified as a primary contributor to prolonged bloom maintenance. Insufficient information is available to delimit specific mechanisms that may play a role in the termination of K. brevis blooms. However, general processes such as macro- and microzooplankton grazing, bacterial and viral cell lysis, and dispersal by physical advection and the break down of fronts, that originally may have acted as concentrating mechanisms, are reviewed.},
