  caption: Lesson on how to convert a list to a tibble.
repo: ~
summary: Function returns and data are often in list form.  Some, like myself, prefer to convert them to a table or data frame to perform computations.  Lists of equal lengths are easy to convert to a table, but lists of unequal lengths are problematic.  The tibble package allows for lists to be stored in the column of the dataframe.

# [Overview](#overview)

This post discusses inserting a list into a data frame or converting one to a data frame.  While it may be achieved within the traditional data frame, we will use the tibble package to accomplish the task.  

Converting a list to a tibble will require the some knowledge of three packages: `tibble`, `tidyr`, and `purrr` package. Here, the workflow will be introduced touching upon the most common approaches with simple exercises. More rigorous examples of lists to tibbles are reserved for [Rectangling - Part 04](https://robwiederstein.org) and [Use Cases - Part 05](https://robwiederstein.org).  The concept of a "list-column" figures prominently in the discussion.  It is a powerful method for storing one or more lists within a single tibble.


According to the `tibble` package details, "[t]ibble is the central data structure for the set of packages known as the `tidyverse`. Tidyverse packages include `dplyr`, `ggplot2` and `tidyr`. The objective is to have a data frame where a list can be stored in a column and `tibble` provides this functionality. ("tibble" and "data frame" are often used interchangeably.)

# [tibbles](#tibbles)

A tibble is a new take on data frames.  A tibble is a data frame but it changes the default behaviors of R's older data frame type. A tibble is different from the traditional data frame in the following ways:

-  does not change an input's type
-  it makes it easier to use with list-columns
-  variable names are not changed
-  it evaluates its arguments lazily and sequentially,
-  it never uses `row.names()`
-  it only recycles vectors of length 1

A [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) devotes a Chapter 10 to tibbles.

## Create via as_tibble()

```{r tibble-iris-df, echo=T}
tibble::as_tibble(iris[1:5, ])
```

## Create via tribble()

When entering data by hand, it may be easier to create the table using `tribble()`, short for "transposed table."

```{r tribble-df, echo=T, tidy=T}
tibble::tribble(
    ~x, ~y, ~z,
    #--|--|-- <--Hadley Wickham does this!
    "a", 1, 1.1,
    "b", 2, 2.1
)
```

# [Key Point](#key-point)

Lists can be described as having equal lengths or varying lengths.  A list in the form `list(a = 1, b =1)` is a list where there is one element to each named list. Thus, the list is one where the elements are of equal lengths.

```{r list-equal-lengths-illustration, echo=T}
list(a = 1, b = 1) |> map_dbl(length)
```

However, lists are commonly of varying lengths like `list(a = 1, b = c(1, 2))`.  Such a list would be described as having unequal or varying lengths.

```{r list-unequal-lengths-illustration, echo=T}
list(a = 1, b = c(1, 2)) |> map_dbl(length)
```

Where a list contains the same number of elements as rows in a data frame, it is both conceptually easy to visualize and, with some creativity, to assign it to a column.

```{r tibble-equal-lengths-illustration, echo=T}
ll <- list(a = c(1, 2), b = c(1, 2))
dt <- tibble(
    names = c("a", "b"),
    a = ll[["a"]],
    b = ll[["b"]]
)
dt
```

However, when lists are of unequal lengths, the solution is not as apparent.

```{r tibble-unequal-lengths-illustration, echo=T}
ll <- list(a = 1, b = 1:5)
dt <- tibble(
    names = c("a", "b"),
    lists = ll
)
dt
```

Rather than the values of the list being added, tibble created a column by default to store lists. This is extremely convenient, but a little confusing to get used to. Lists of unequal lengths are the most likely, but not exclusively, candidates to be stored within a tibble list-column.

# [List-columns](#list-columns)

The columns of a tibble are usually an atomic vector, with each column sharing the same length and data type. However, a tibble can have a column that contains a list, also known as a "list-column". List-columns can contain any of the different data types, making them extremely useful within a tibble.

A list-column can be created in several ways. List-columns are addressed in the context of models in [R for Data Science--Chapter 25--Many Models](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html?q=list-c#list-columns-1) and also in an evolving text, [Functional Programming](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/list-columns.html)

## With tibble()

```{r tibble-list-column, echo=T}
tibble(x = 1:3, y = list(1:5, 1:10, 1:20))
```

## With enframe()

### Example 1

```{r enframe-list-column-1, echo=T}
list(1:3) |> enframe(name = NULL)
```
### Example 2

```{r enframe-list-column-2, echo=T}
list(a = 1, b = 2, c = c(3, 4)) |> enframe(name = "name")
```
## With tidyr::nest()

```{r nest-list-column, echo=T}
x_data <- tibble(x = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3), y = 1:6, z = 6:1) |>
    nest(data = c(y, z))
x_data
```

## Unnest list-column
```{r unnest-list-column, echo=T}
x_data |> unnest(data)
```


# [list of equal lengths](#equal-lengths)

There are a variety of ways to convert lists of equal lengths to a data frame. Here are three potential solutions. There are many others suggested in the StackOverflow question:
[Convert a list to a data frame](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4227223/convert-a-list-to-a-data-frame).

```{r list-equal-lengths, echo=T}
# create list
ll <- list(a = c(1, 2), b = c(3, 4), c = c("x", "y"))
```


## Solution 1 - tibble

```{r list-equal-lengths-solution-1, echo=T}
# as tibble
tibble(
    a = ll[["a"]],
    b = ll[["b"]],
    c = ll$c
)
```
## Solution 2 - dplyr

```{r lists-equal-lengths-solution-2, echo=T}
# as tibble
dplyr::bind_rows(ll)
```

## Solution 3 - purrr

```{r lists-equal-lengths-solution-3, echo = T}
ll |>
    map_dfc(~ as_tibble(.x)) |>
    setNames(c("a", "b", "c"))
```

```{r}
ll |>
    simplify_all()
```

# [Prelude to Rectangling](#prelude)

Before leaping into the dense vignette on "rectangling", I thought we'd ease in to the topic with some short, easy-to-inspect data.

## JSON List

This json snippet represents the contact information for a single person, "Joe Jackson." Note that the "address" and "phoneNumbers" fields are nested.

```{r json-list, echo=T}
jsonList <- list(rjson::fromJSON('
{
   "firstName": "Joe",
   "lastName": "Jackson",
   "gender": "male",
   "age": 28,
   "address": {
       "streetAddress": "101",
       "city": "San Diego",
       "state": "CA"
   },
   "phoneNumbers": [
       { "type": "home", "number": "7349282382" }
   ]
}
'))
```

First, assign the json list to a tibble.  The resulting tibble is a single list-column and the variable is named "contact."

```{r json-list-tibble, echo=T}
contacts <- tibble(contact = jsonList)
# tibble with single list column
contacts
```


Finally, unnest the different columns.  This was accomplished only after several attempts.

```{r json-list-unnested, echo=T}
contacts |>
    unnest_wider(contact) |>
    unnest_wider(address) |>
    unnest_wider(phoneNumbers) |>
    unnest_wider(`...1`)
```

## XML list

This is the same Joe Jackson data as before but in XML.

```{r xml-list, echo=T}
library(xml2)
xmlList <- as_list(read_xml(
    '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <root>
        <firstName>Joe</firstName>
        <lastName>Jackson</lastName>
        <gender>male</gender>
        <age>28</age>
        <address>
        <streetAddress>101</streetAddress>
        <city>San Diego</city>
        <state>CA</state>
        </address>
        <phoneNumbers>
        <type>home</type>
        <number>7349282382</number>
        </phoneNumbers>
        </root>
        '
) |> xml_ns_strip())
```

```{r xml-list-tibble, echo=T}
# tibble with single nested column
contacts <- tibble(contact = xmlList)
contacts
```

```{r xml-list-tibble-unnested, echo = T}

df <- contacts |>
    unnest_wider(contact) |>
    unnest_wider(address) |>
    unnest_wider(phoneNumbers) |>
    mutate(across(everything(), unlist))
```


# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

In this post, we learned about the the tibble package and how to include or convert a list to a column in a tibble.  Lists can either be of equal or unequal lengths.  Where lists are of unequal lengths, a simple strategy is to include them in a tibble as a list-column.  We also looked at how .json and .xml data is imported as a list and how to convert the list to a tibble using the `tidyr` function `unnest_wider()`.
