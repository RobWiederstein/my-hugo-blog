# [Overview](#overview)

If you could retire anywhere in the United States, where would you go?  It's an important and worthwhile question for those wanting to enjoy their final years and it's linked to what each of us values. The dashboard includes a wide variety of factors including health, economic, weather and housing. A total of seventeen different criteria are included to help winnow the US 3142 counties down to a reasonable amount.

For my spouse and me, we were looking for a larger community with access to healthcare and a decent sized airport for more flexibility in travel.  Additionally, we were hoping to find someplace without snow and ice, but it didn't have to be in Florida.  We also we're hoping to relocate within a 12 hour drive from family.  The Southeast states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina were the focus of our search.

There's a lot to experiment with in the dashboard and I hope you enjoy it!
