# [Introduction](#overview)

This post is an introduction to working with the `sf` package.  "sf" is short for "simple features" and is an open source model and standard to interact with vector geometries. Downloads of the `sf` package now exceed other `R` packages dealing with spatial data.

The simple features [package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) was first released in January, 2017. Its design and philosophy is to mirror other packages included in the "tidyverse".  Thus, manipulating data in  `sf` classed objects is similar to how it would be accomplished in `dplyr`.

Robin Lovelace is an authority in the field who has been immensely active in geospatial development for R.  He is a contributor to the `sf` package.  His book, "[Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html)" is recommended. My first exposure to his work was a tutorial that used a previous package and his work was consulted every time I had to do a merge/join.

This post extracts portions of his book that are most commonly performed in everyday spatial analysis. An excellent [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/sf.pdf) is also available.  Two sources of data are used: the US Census Bureau county gis and USDA median income.

A

# [US Census Bureau](#CB)

The county geospatial [data]() come from the US Census.

```{r fetch-census-bureau, message = F, include = F}
#download file to local drive
url <- "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2020/shp/cb_2020_us_county_20m.zip"
destfile <- "cb_2020_us_county_20m.zip"
if(!file.exists(destfile)){download.file(url = url, destfile = destfile)}
```

```{r load-data, echo = T}
#read in file
library(sf)
#all counties
counties <- 
  sf::st_read(
    dsn = "cb_2020_us_county_20m", 
    layer = "cb_2020_us_county_20m"
    ) |>
  # convert coordinates to simple feature
  sf::st_transform('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84') |>
  # reduce file size
	sf::st_simplify() |> 
  # convert variables to lowercase
  dplyr::rename_all(~janitor::make_clean_names(.x))
```

# [Subset to State](#subset)

Filter the dataframe to the state of interest. The result can be reached using a `dplyr` pipe.

```{r subset-to-state, echo = T}
#california fips is "06"
ca <- 
  counties |> 
  dplyr::filter(grepl("06", statefp))
```

# [Sanity Check](#sanity-check)

Before we get too much further down this rabbit hole, let's check and make sure we have something to plot. Good news!  That looks like California to me.

```{r sanity-check, echo = T}
plot(ca |> dplyr::select(countyfp))
```

# [Subset to Counties](#subset-counties)
 
```{r subset-to-counties}
ca_counties <-
  ca |> 
  dplyr::filter(name %in% c("Los Angeles", "San Francisco", "Napa")) 

library(leaflet)
  leaflet() |> 
    #setView(-120.52462403790528, 37.74238197955183, zoom = 5) |>
    fitBounds(-122.6, 32.8, -117.6, 38.8) |> 
    addTiles() |> 
    addPolygons(data = ca_counties,
                popup = ~name)
```
# [Group Counties by Dplyr](#group-counties-dplyr)

```{r group-counties-by-dplyr, echo=T}
counties_join_by_group <-
	ca |>
	dplyr::mutate(number = 1) |>
	dplyr::group_by(statefp) |>
	dplyr::summarize(tot = sum(number))
```

```{r map-counties-by-dplyr, echo = T}
#map 
leaflet() |> 
    #fitBounds(-124.4, 32.5, -114.1,  42) |> 
        setView(-120.52462403790528, 37.74238197955183, zoom = 5) |>
    addTiles() |> 
    addPolygons(data = counties_join_by_group)
```


# [Counties Join by Union](#counties-join-by-union)

The other way to join geographic subdivisions together is through the use of `sf::st_union()`.

```{r join-by-union, echo = T}
# join counties into California
counties_join_by_union <- sf::st_union(ca)
# map
leaflet() %>%
	fitBounds(-124.4, 32.5, -114.1,  42) |> 
	#base groups
	addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") |>
	addPolygons(
		data = counties_join_by_union
	)
```
# [Calculate Centroids](#centroids)

```{r centroids, echo = T}
centroids <- sf::st_centroid(ca)
leaflet() |>
	fitBounds(-122.6, 32.8, -117.6, 38.8) |> 
	#base groups
	addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") |>
	#layer groups
	addPolygons(data = sf::st_union(ca),
		    group = "State") |>
	addPolygons(data = ca,
		    group = "Counties") |>
	addMarkers(lat = unlist(lapply(centroids$geometry, "[[", 2)),
		   lng = unlist(lapply(centroids$geometry, "[[", 1)),
		   group = "Centroids"
	) |>
	#layer control
	addLayersControl(
		overlayGroups = c("State", "Counties", "Centroids"),
		position = "topright",
		options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
	) |>
	# hide
	hideGroup(c("State", "Counties", "Centroids"))
```

# [Merge](#merge)

Maps are commonly used as choropleth and, therefore, are often merged with data.  Here, the USDA compiles some data by county in the US.

```{r fetch-usda, echo = T, cache = T}
file <- 'https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/Unemployment.xlsx'
usda <- rio::import(
        file = file,
        skip = 4
) |> 
        dplyr::rename_all(~janitor::make_clean_names(.x)) |> 
        dplyr::select(fips_code:area_name, unemployment_rate_2020) |> 
        dplyr::filter(state == "CA") |> 
        tidyr::separate(fips_code, into = c("statefp", "countyfp"), sep = 2) |> 
        dplyr::select(statefp, countyfp, unemployment_rate_2020)
```

```{r merge-usda-uscb}
ca_choropleth <-
        dplyr::left_join(ca, usda, by = c("statefp", "countyfp"))
```

```{r map-usda-uscb, eval = T, include = T}
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Dark2"),
             domain = ca_choropleth$unemployment_rate_2020
)
leaflet() |>
	fitBounds(-122.6, 32.8, -117.6, 38.8) |> 
	#base groups
	addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") |> 
        addPolygons(data = ca_choropleth,
                    color = ~pal(unemployment_rate_2020),
                    popup = ~unemployment_rate_2020)

```
