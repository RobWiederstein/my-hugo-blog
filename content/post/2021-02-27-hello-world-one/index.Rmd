## R image


```{r plot-mtcars, echo=F, fig.cap = "A plot with 538 layout theme and color blind palette."}
data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, group = cyl, colour = cyl))
p <- p + scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette)
p <- p + geom_point(size = 2)
p <- p + ggtitle("mtcars")
p
```

## Custom image

The easiest option is to use the  _Insert Image_ RStudio addin to add an external image.
