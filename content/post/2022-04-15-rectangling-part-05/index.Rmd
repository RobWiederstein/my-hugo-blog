# [Overview](#overview)

This post is an abbreviated version of  the `tidyr` vignette on rectangling. According to the vignette, "[r]ectangling is the art and craft of taking a deeply nested list (often sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data set of rows and columns." If you prefer to interactively explore the vignette from the command line, you'll need to install `tidyr`, `dplyr` and `repurrrsive` packages.

```{r run-vignette, echo=T, eval=F}
#load packages
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(repurrrsive)
#load vignette in help window
vignette("rectangle", package = "tidyr")
```

Or the vignette is available on its own web [page](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html). The workhorse of the effort are permutations of the `unnest_*` function and `hoist()`.  Both are in the `tidyr` package.

The general workfow of rectangling is to populate a tibble with a list.  Nested lists will be converted to list-columns whereby the various "unnest" function can be applied like `unnest_wider`, `unnest_longer` and `unnest_auto` can be used.  Where only small portions of a list are to be retained, `hoist()` may be a more efficient alternative.

# [GitHub users -- unnest_wider()](#gh_users)

## Insert into tibble

```{r gh-users-insert, echo=T}
users <- tibble(user = gh_users)
```

## Inspect

```{r gh-users-inspect, echo=T}
names(users$user[[1]])
```


## unnest_wider()

```{r gh-users-unnest, echo=T}
users |> unnest_wider(user)
```

## hoist()

```{r gh-users-hoist, echo=T}
users %>% hoist(
    user,
    followers = "followers",
    login = "login",
    url = "html_url"
)
```

# [GitHub repos - unnest_longer()](#gh-repos)
## Insert into tibble

```{r rgh-repo-insert, echo=T}
repos <- tibble(repo = repurrrsive::gh_repos)
```

## Inspect

```{r gh-repo-inspect, echo=T}
repos
```

## unnest_longer()

```{r gh-repo-unnest-longer, echo=T}
repos <- repos %>% unnest_longer(repo)
repos
```

## hoist()

```{r gh-repo-hoist, echo=T}
repos %>% hoist(
    repo,
    login = c("owner", "login"), #<===
    name = "name",
    homepage = "homepage",
    watchers = "watchers_count"
)
```

# [Game of Throne Characters](#got-chars)

## Insert into tibble

```{r got-chars-insert}
chars <- tibble(char = got_chars)
```

## Inspect

```{r got-chars-inspect}
chars
```

## unnest_wider()

```{r got-chars-wider}
chars2 <- chars %>% unnest_wider(char)
chars2
```

When the tibble was unnested, there are a collection of list-columns. To see which columns are of the class `list`, you can use dplyr's   `select_if` function.

```{r got-chars-list-columns, echo=T}
chars2 %>% select_if(is.list)
```

## Build table

```{r got-chars-table}
chars2 %>% 
  select(name, books, tvSeries) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(books, tvSeries), names_to = "media", values_to = "value") %>% 
  unnest_longer(value)
```

# [Sharla Gelfand’s Discography](#discography)

## Insert into tibble

```{r disc-insert-tibble, echo=T}
discs <- tibble(disc = discog) %>%
    unnest_wider(disc) %>%
    mutate(date_added = as.POSIXct(strptime(date_added, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")))
```

## Inspect

Examine data.

```{r disc-inspect, echo=T}
discs
```

The list-column "basic_information" needs to be unnested so the disc information can be viewed.

```{r disc-inspect-error, echo=T, error=TRUE}
discs |> unnest_wider(basic_information)
```


## Fix duplicate names

```{r disc-duplicate-names, echo=TRUE}
discs %>% unnest_wider(basic_information, names_repair = "unique")
```

## drop id column

`basic-information` repeats the id column so drop it.

```{r disc-drop-id, echo=TRUE}
discs %>%
    select(!id) %>%
    unnest_wider(basic_information)
```

## `hoist()` alternative

```{r disc-hoist, echo=TRUE}
discs %>%
    hoist(
        basic_information,
        title = "title",
        year = "year",
        label = list("labels", 1, "name"),
        artist = list("artists", 1, "name")
    )
```


## Better alternative

A better alternative would be to create separate tables for artist and label:

```{r disc-alternative-artist, echo=TRUE}
# artist
discs %>%
    hoist(basic_information, artist = "artists") %>%
    select(disc_id = id, artist) %>%
    unnest_longer(artist) %>%
    unnest_wider(artist)
```


```{r disc-alternative-label, echo=TRUE}
#discs
discs %>%
    hoist(basic_information, format = "formats") %>%
    select(disc_id = id, format) %>%
    unnest_longer(format) %>%
    unnest_wider(format) %>%
    unnest_longer(descriptions)
```

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

This post closely followed the `tidyr` vignette "Rectangling." That said, the section on google geocoding was omitted.  The vignette demonstrated the use of `unnest_wider()`, `unnest_longer()`, and `hoist()`.  It also showed how to solve an error when names in a list are duplicated by adding the argument `names_repair = "unique"`.
