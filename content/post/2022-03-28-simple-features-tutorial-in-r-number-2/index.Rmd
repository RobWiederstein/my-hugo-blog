# [Introduction](#overview)

This post is an introduction to working with the `sf` package.  "sf" is short for "simple features" and is an open-source model and standard to interact with vector geometries. Downloads of the `sf` package now exceed other `R` packages dealing with spatial data.

The simple features [package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) was first released in January 2017. Its design and philosophy mirror other packages included in the "tidyverse".  Thus, manipulating data in  `sf` classed objects is similar to how it would be accomplished in `dplyr`.

Robin Lovelace is an authority in the field who has been immensely active in geospatial development for R.  He is a contributor to the `sf` package.  His book, "[Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html)" is recommended. My first exposure to his work was a tutorial that used a previous package and his work was consulted every time I had to do a merge/join.

This post extracts portions of his book that are most commonly performed in everyday spatial analysis. An excellent [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/sf.pdf) is also available.  Two sources of data are used: the US Census Bureau cartographic boundaries for counties and USDA county unemployment files.

# [US Census Bureau](#uscb)

The county geospatial [data](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html) come from the US Census.

```{r fetch-census-bureau, message = F, include = F}
#download file to local drive
url <- "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2020/shp/cb_2020_us_county_20m.zip"
destfile <- "cb_2020_us_county_20m.zip"
if(!file.exists(destfile)){download.file(url = url, destfile = destfile)}
```

```{r load-data, echo = T}
#read in file
library(sf)
#all counties
counties <- 
  sf::st_read(
    dsn = "cb_2020_us_county_20m",
    #do not put file extentsion .shp on end!
    layer = "cb_2020_us_county_20m"
    ) |>
  # convert coordinates to simple feature
  sf::st_transform('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84') |>
  # reduce file size
	sf::st_simplify() |> 
  # convert variables to lowercase
  dplyr::rename_all(~janitor::make_clean_names(.x))
```

# [Subset to State](#subset)

Filter the dataframe to the state of interest. The result can be reached using a `dplyr` pipe.

```{r subset-to-state, echo = T}
#california fips is "06"
ca <- 
  counties |> 
  dplyr::filter(grepl("06", statefp))
```

# [Sanity Check](#sanity-check)

Before proceeding futher, efficiency requires the collected data represents what we intended; namely, the state of California.  After inspection, we appear headed on the right track.

```{r sanity-check, echo = T}
plot(ca |> dplyr::select(countyfp))
```


# [Subset to Counties](#subset-counties)
 
 Next, let's choose three random California counties and plot them using Leaflet.
 
```{r subset-to-counties, echo = T}
ca_counties <-
  ca |> 
  dplyr::filter(name %in% c("Los Angeles", "San Francisco", "Napa")) 

library(leaflet)
  leaflet() |> 
    fitBounds(-122.6, 32.8, -117.6, 38.8) |> 
    addTiles() |> 
    addPolygons(data = ca_counties,
                popup = ~name)
```
# [Group Counties by Dplyr](#group-counties-dplyr)

```{r group-counties-by-dplyr, echo=T}
counties_join_by_group <-
	ca |>
	dplyr::mutate(number = 1) |>
	dplyr::group_by(statefp) |>
	dplyr::summarize(tot = sum(number))
```

```{r map-counties-by-dplyr, echo = T}
#map 
leaflet() |> 
    #fitBounds(-124.4, 32.5, -114.1,  42) |> 
        setView(-120.52462403790528, 37.74238197955183, zoom = 5) |>
    addTiles() |> 
    addPolygons(data = counties_join_by_group)
```


# [Counties Join by Union](#counties-join-by-union)

The other way to join geographic subdivisions together is through the use of `sf::st_union()`.

```{r join-by-union, echo = T}
# join counties into California
counties_join_by_union <- sf::st_union(ca)
# map
leaflet() %>%
	fitBounds(-124.4, 32.5, -114.1,  42) |> 
	#base groups
	addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") |>
	addPolygons(
		data = counties_join_by_union
	)
```

# [Calculate Centroids](#centroids)

```{r centroids, echo = T}
centroids <- sf::st_centroid(ca)
leaflet() |>
	fitBounds(-122.6, 32.8, -117.6, 38.8) |> 
	#base groups
	addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") |>
	#layer groups
	addPolygons(data = sf::st_union(ca),
		    group = "State") |>
	addPolygons(data = ca,
		    group = "Counties") |>
	addMarkers(lat = unlist(lapply(centroids$geometry, "[[", 2)),
		   lng = unlist(lapply(centroids$geometry, "[[", 1)),
		   group = "Centroids"
	) |>
	#layer control
	addLayersControl(
		overlayGroups = c("State", "Counties", "Centroids"),
		position = "topright",
		options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
	) |>
	# hide
	hideGroup(c("State", "Counties", "Centroids"))
```

# [Merge](#merge)

Maps are commonly used as choropleths, i.e. the polygon is colored based on another variable. Thus, spatial data are often merged with other data.  Here, the USDA compiles some data by county in the US. The data are winnowed to identification variables and a single numeric named "unemployment_rate_2020". Then the USDA data is merged with the California counties' data.

```{r fetch-usda, echo = T, cache = T}
file <- 'https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/Unemployment.xlsx'
usda <- rio::import(
        file = file,
        skip = 4
) |> 
        dplyr::rename_all(~janitor::make_clean_names(.x)) |> 
        dplyr::select(fips_code:area_name, unemployment_rate_2020) |> 
        dplyr::filter(state == "CA") |> 
        tidyr::separate(fips_code, into = c("statefp", "countyfp"), sep = 2) |> 
        dplyr::select(statefp, countyfp, unemployment_rate_2020)
```

The files' order matters when perfoming the merge. By putting the "ca" simple feature class dataframe first, the subsequent "usda" dataframe morphs into the same simple feature class and is now combined. See Professor Lovelace's Geospatial in R 3.2.4 [vector attribute joining](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/attr.html#vector-attribute-joining) for more details.


```{r merge-usda-uscb, echo = T}
ca_choropleth <-
        dplyr::left_join(ca, usda, by = c("statefp", "countyfp"))
```


# [Choropleth Map](#choropleth)

California counties are shaded by the 2020 unemployment rate.


```{r map-usda-uscb, eval = T, include = T}
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "BrBG"),
             domain = ca_choropleth$unemployment_rate_2020
)
leaflet() |>
	fitBounds(-122.6, 32.8, -117.6, 38.8) |> 
	#base groups
	addTiles(group = "OSM (default)") |> 
        addPolygons(data = ca_choropleth,
                    color = ~pal(unemployment_rate_2020),
                    label = ~unemployment_rate_2020)

```

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

This tutorial demonstrated how to: (1) read in, transform, and minimize a shapefile; (2) select a single state's counties from the Census Bureau cartographic boundaries file; (3) plot a shapefile using the simple `plot()` function; (4) dissolve internal boundaries of a state using the `dplyr::group_by()` function and the `sf::st_union()` function; (5) calculate the geographic centers of polygons with the `sf::st_centroid()` function; (6) use the layers feature in `leaflet` to place multiple geographic datasets onto a map; (7) merge a dataframe/tibble/datatable with a simple feature collection; and (8) create a choropleth map in leaflet using a divergent color palette from `RColorBrewer`.
