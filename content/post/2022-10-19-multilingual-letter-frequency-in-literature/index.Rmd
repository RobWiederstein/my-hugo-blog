summary: This post is about letter frequency from four works of literature.  Each one is in a different language.  Letter frequency analysis is how simple substitution ciphers are cracked in cryptography.

# [Overview](#overview)

Recently, I've been studying cryptography. Or, more accurately, a couple of family members have been studying it.  For inspiration, we watched "[The Imitation Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game)," starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly.  It's a great movie and a celebration of one of the great intellects of the twentieth century Alan Turing.  He is widely considered the creator of the modern computer. Along with many others at Bletchley Park, he broke Germany's Enigma code accelerating the Allied victory.

# [Caesar Cipher](#caesar)

A "caesar cipher" is a simple shift of the alphabet to encode data.  If you shift the alphabet 7 spaces an "A" would become the seventh letter "G". This kind of encoding is easily broken by studying the frequency of letters within a language.  In English, "E" is the most common letter.  It represents somewhere around 12.5% of all letters.  A seven-letter shift from "E" to "L" would convert all of the "Es" to "Ls".  "L" would then be present in 12.5% of the total characters in a text.

# [Gutenbergr Package](#gutenbergr)

With the `Gutenbergr` package in R, public domain texts are freely available.   The collection is large and contains 60,000+ free eBooks in different languages.  I chose four well-known works of literature one from English (en), Spanish (es), German (de), and French (fr).  The texts are "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville, Don Quijote by Cervantes, Faust by Goethe and Les Miserables by Victor Hugo.  

These were in the original language. Only the ten most frequent letters from Moby Dick were included. There were similar distributions of the letters for the other languages.
