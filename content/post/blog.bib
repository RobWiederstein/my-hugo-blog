Data used include measurements of temperature and humidity sensors from a wireless network, weather from a nearby airport station and recorded energy use of lighting fixtures. The paper discusses data filtering to remove non-predictive parameters and feature ranking. Four statistical models were trained with repeated cross validation and evaluated in a testing set: (a) multiple linear regression, (b) support vector machine with radial kernel, (c) random forest and (d) gradient boosting machines (GBM). The best model (GBM) was able to explain 97\% of the variance (R2) in the training set and with 57\% in the testing set when using all the predictors. From the wireless network, the data from the kitchen, laundry and living room were ranked the highest in importance for the energy prediction. The prediction models with only the weather data, selected the atmospheric pressure (which is correlated to wind speed) as the most relevant weather data variable in the prediction. Therefore, atmospheric pressure may be important to include in energy prediction models and for building performance modeling.},

Although no aircraft accidents have yet been directly attributed to laser attacks to date, experts agree that it is a legitimate threat to safety. To better understand this phenomenon, and ways in which it can be addressed, an important area to understand is the public perception of the severity of such incidents. This would include examining the attitudes the general public hold toward laser attacks, and what views they may hold towards regulation and punishment for these offences. Members of the general public (N=208) completed an online survey that examined their views towards the perceived occurrences and severity of laser attacks, whilst also examining their expectation of criminality and punishment of using a laser against an aircraft. Responses were analysed and presented, with discussion around the nature of public perception and expectation to laser attacks. Mitigations and interventions are explored, focussing on targeted educational/awareness programs that can be used to increase the awareness amongst the general public on the consequences of laser attacks on aircraft.},

Field-collected energy use data from these applinaces in 326 residential buildings is collected for a 1-year period and analyzed. Uncertainty analysis is based on the Monte Carlo simulation method, showing the different possible ranges of demand response for each appliance. Clothes dryers are found to have the strongest demand response potential, due in part to their high power demand when on. However this high peak reduction occurs in the afternoon and evening only, as dryers are found to be used very little in the night and morning. Refrigerators provide the second strongest demand response potential, in part due to the nearly 100\% of residential buildings that have one or more of them, and the higher predictability of their electricity demand behavior. In addition, unlike dryers, refrigerators have a similar demnad response potential at all times of the day. Clothes washers and dishwasher were found to have the least demand response potential. Results of this work are intended to provide updated information on power demand and time of use of appliances and a methodology for assessment of demand response and peak load reduction of smart applinaces on a house-by-house or community scale.},

We used the AnAge database to study these factors, particularly metabolism and developmental schedules, previously associated with longevity in vertebrate species. Our results show that, after correcting for body mass and phylogeny, basal metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in eutherians or birds, although it negatively correlates with marsupial longevity and time to maturity. We confirm the idea that age at maturity is typically proportional to adult life span, and show that mammals that live longer for their body size, such as bats and primates, also tend to have a longer developmental time for their body size. Lastly, postnatal growth rates were negatively correlated with adult life span in mammals but not in birds. Our work provides a detailed view of factors related to species longevity with implications for how comparative studies of aging are interpreted.},

Yet, women have only recently gained entrance to peak judicial bodies including constitutional and supreme courts. The appointment of the first woman to a high court is a historic landmark, breaking traditional ideas of who can and should be on the court. Using a global, longitudinal data set we show that certain explanatory factors matter differently in wealthy, stable democracies and in developing countries. The method of selecting high court justices exerts influence in wealthy, stable democracies but not newer ones. Further, our findings suggest that in both sets of countries, appointments to high courts are not made in a domestic vacuum and are influenced by international norms of having women participate in governing institutions.},

  abstract = {Longevity is a major characteristic of animals that has long fascinated scientists. In this work, we present a comprehensive database of animal longevity records and related life-history traits entitled AnAge, which we compiled and manually curated from an extensive literature. AnAge started as a collection of longevity records, but has since been expanded to include quantitative data for numerous other life-history traits, including body masses at different developmental stages, reproductive data such as age at sexual maturity and measurements of reproductive output, and physiological traits related to metabolism. AnAge features over 4000 vertebrate species and is a central resource for applying the comparative method to studies of longevity and life-history evolution across the tree of life. Moreover, by providing a reference value for longevity and other life-history traits, AnAge can prove valuable to a broad range of biologists working in evolutionary biology, ecology, zoology, physiology and conservation biology.

  abstract = {modelsummary is a package to summarize data and statistical models in R. It supports over one hundred types of models out-of-the-box, and allows users to report the results of those models side-by-side in a table, or in coefficient plots. It makes it easy to execute common tasks such as computing robust standard errors, adding significance stars, and manipulating coefficient and model labels. Beyond model summaries, the package also includes a suite of tools to produce highly flexible data summary tables, such as dataset overviews, correlation matrices, (multi-level) cross-tabulations, and balance tables (also known as "Table 1"). The appearance of the tables produced by modelsummary can be customized using external packages such as kableExtra, gt, flextable, or huxtable; the plots can be customized using ggplot2. Tables can be exported to many output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Text/Markdown, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, RTF, PDF, and image files. Tables and plots can be embedded seamlessly in rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave dynamic documents. The modelsummary package is designed to be simple, robust, modular, and extensible.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION. Laser illuminations of aircraft have resulted in pilots reporting distraction, disruption, disorientation, adverse visual effects, and operational problems that put at risk the safety of the aircraft and those onboard. FAA Order 7400.2 was revised in 1995 to establish lower laser exposure limits that protected flight crewmembers in specific zones of airspace around airports. However, helicopters (including police, air ambulance, military, and news media aircraft) that routinely operate at low altitudes outside these zones continue to be exposed to hazardous levels of laser radiation. This study examines the frequency of these events and adverse effects of laser illuminations involving helicopters compared with fixed-wing aircraft for a 32-year study period (from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2011). METHODS. Reports of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft illuminated by high-intensity light have been collected from various sources and entered into a database maintained by the Vision Research Team at the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. The frequency of laser illumination events involving aircraft in the United States were stratified by altitude into 1,000-foot increments, categorized, and analyzed. Analysis included identifying adverse effects experienced by helicopter flight crewmembers, compared to those experienced by crewmembers of fixed-wing aircraft. RESULTS. The majority of helicopter laser exposures (70\% or 751/1,072) were within the altitude limit established for the Laser Free Zone (LFZ ≤ 2,000 feet) versus only 18\% (1,980/11,111) for fixed-wing aircraft. More than 86\% (328/379) of all adverse effects reported by helicopter pilots were in this altitude range, compared to 29\% (294/1,027) of all fixed-wing effects reported.

  abstract = {Lake trophic state classifications provide information about the condition of lentic ecosystems and are indicative of both ecosystem services (e.g., clean water, recreational opportunities, and aesthetics) and disservices (e.g., cyanobacteria blooms). The current classification schemes have been criticized for developing indices that are single-variable based (vs. a complex aggregate of multi-variables), discrete (vs. a continuous), and/or deterministic (vs. an inherently random). We present an updated lake trophic classification model using a Bayesian multilevel ordered categorical regression. The model consists of a proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) that models ordered, categorical, lake trophic state using Secchi disk depth, elevation, nitrogen concentration (N), and phosphorus concentration (P). The overall accuracy, when compared to existing classifications of trophic state index (TSI), for the POLR model was 0.68 and the balanced accuracy ranged between 0.72 and 0.93. This work delivers an index that is multi-variable based, continuous, and classifies lakes in probabilistic terms. While our model addresses aforementioned limitations of the current approach to lake trophic classification, the addition of uncertainty quantification is important, because the trophic state response to predictors varies among lakes. Our model successfully addresses concerns with the current approach and performs well across trophic states in a large spatial extent.},

  abstract = {770~million motorcycles are estimated on the roads. Motorcyclists represent more than 380,000 annual deaths worldwide. 28\% of the global fatalities in the roads in 2016. With the increase of the accident rate, studies have been developed within the scientific literature. Bibliometric analysis is applied in the field of motorcycle safety in order to identify relevant publications on risk factors of road crashes and their implications. The information in this research was extracted from Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1947 and May 31, 2018. The study identified the key bibliometric indicators such as publications, authors, journals, countries, institutions, citation and co-citation analysis, subject categories, and co-occurrence of terms. EndNote, Microsoft Excel, Statgraphics Centurion and VOS-viewer software were used for the analysis. In total, 1813 articles were considered. The publications from 2000 to 2017 exhibits an average growth of 9\%. The journal “Accident Analysis and Prevention” was the key issue in the publication and citation. The top institutions were the University of California, Universiti Putra Malaysia, and Monash University. The average citation of the top 10 articles was 134. A network visualization map showed that ‘vehicle’, ‘model’, ‘system’, ‘road’, ‘safety’, and ‘behavior’ were the most commons key terms. Bibliometric analysis demonstrates a high collaboration between authors and institutions. Two growing trends were identified. First, studies on the protection of the motorcyclist and the safe design considering the performance. Second, studies in analysis, characterization, and prevention of accidents. These studies are more related to the generation of strategies for the protection of road safety for motorcyclists.},

While many classification methods have been proposed, there is no consensus on which methods are more suitable for a given dataset. As a consequence, it is important to comprehensively compare methods in many possible scenarios. In this context, we performed a systematic comparison of 9 well-known clustering methods available in the R language assuming normally distributed data. In order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes, separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach tended to present particularly good performance. We also found that the default configuration of the adopted implementations was not always accurate. In these cases, a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms.},

We introduce a new public data set that extends existing data on lynching victims to cover the contiguous United States from 1883 to 1941. These data confirm that lynching was a heterogeneous practice across the United States. We differentiate between three different regimes over this period: a Wild West regime, characterized mostly by the lynching of whites in areas with weak state penetration; a slavery regime, found in former slave states, characterized mostly by the lynching of blacks; and a third minor regime, characterized by the lynching of Mexican nationals mostly along the Texas-Mexico border. We also note great variability at the county level in the extent of lynching. By contrast, we find very little state-level variability in lynching once local and regional regimes are considered. We discuss the implications of local and regional heterogeneity for quantitative lynching research using these data.},

  abstract = {Visualizations often encode numeric data using sequential and diverging color ramps. Effective ramps use colors that are sufficiently discriminable, align well with the data, and are aesthetically pleasing. Designers rely on years of experience to create high-quality color ramps. However, it is challenging for novice visualization developers that lack this experience to craft effective ramps as most guidelines for constructing ramps are loosely defined qualitative heuristics that are often difficult to apply. Our goal is to enable visualization developers to readily create effective color encodings using a single seed color. We do this using an algorithmic approach that models designer practices by analyzing patterns in the structure of designer-crafted color ramps. We construct these models from a corpus of 222 expert-designed color ramps, and use the results to automatically generate ramps that mimic designer practices. We evaluate our approach through an empirical study comparing the outputs of our approach with designer-crafted color ramps. Our models produce ramps that support accurate and aesthetically pleasing visualizations at least as well as designer ramps and that outperform conventional mathematical approaches.},

  abstract = {Comparative differences between species provide a powerful source of information that may inform our understanding of the aging process. However, two problems regularly attend such analyses. The co-variation of traits with body mass is frequently ignored, along with the lack of independence of the data due to a shared phylogenetic history. These problems undermine the use of simple correlations between various factors and maximum lifespan potential (MLSP) across different species as evidence that the factors in question have causal effects on aging. Both of these problems have been widely addressed by comparative biologists working in fields other than aging research, and statistical solutions to these issues are available. Using these statistical approaches, of making analyses of residual traits with the effects of body mass removed, and deriving phylogenetically independent contrasts, will allow analyses of the relationships between physiology and maximum lifespan potential to proceed unhindered by these difficulties, potentially leading to many useful insights into the aging process.},

  abstract = {Building energy prediction plays a vital role in developing a model predictive controller for consumers and optimizing energy distribution plan for utilities. Common approaches for energy prediction include physical models, data-driven models and hybrid models. Among them, data-driven approaches have become a popular topic in recent years due to their ability to discover statistical patterns without expertise knowledge. To acquire the latest research trends, this study first summarizes the limitations of earlier reviews: seldom present comprehensive review for the entire data-driven process for building energy prediction and rarely summarize the input updating strategies when applying the trained data-driven model to multi-step energy prediction. To overcome these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review on building energy prediction, covering the entire data-driven process that includes feature engineering, potential data-driven models and expected outputs. The distribution of 105 papers, which focus on building energy prediction by data-driven approaches, are reviewed over data source, feature types, model utilization and prediction outputs. Then, in order to implement the trained data-driven models into multi-step prediction, input updating strategies are reviewed to deal with the time series property of energy related data. Finally, the review concludes with some potential future research directions based on discussion of existing research gaps.},

  abstract = {Fisheries productivity in the Laurentian Great Lakes has changed dramatically over the past century. Invasions of non-native species and anthropogenically induced environmental changes in habitat quality and quantity have significantly altered the species composition and abundance of Great Lakes fishes, thereby affecting the social and economic well-being of coastal communities that rely on the good and services that these fishes provide. Our increased ability to locate, access, catch, preserve, and transport fish while modifying their habitats has resulted in the loss of native fish populations, which has profoundly impacted the ecological functioning and thus the productivity, structure, and services of Great Lakes ecosystems. Further, our lack of predictable scientific knowledge and control over factors affecting the productivity of the various Great Lakes fisheries, coupled with the failure of fisheries governance systems to manage these resources sustainably, have often left Great Lakes commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries and their local fishing communities impoverished and in disarray. In this paper, we discuss the environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic changes that have characterized the Great Lakes basin in the last century. We also share our perspectives and personal stories about the impacts of these changes on ecosystems, fisheries, and the local and regional communities and economies that depend on them for their health and well-being. A key lesson learned was, that if we are to ensure the integrity and productivity of Great Lakes fisheries in the future, we must become better stewards, possessing a more predictable scientific and ecosystem-based understanding of fishes and their habitats while communicating the value of fisheries in food, recreational opportunities, and the economic and social wealth of local communities. The fate of Great Lakes fisheries and the quality of life of the people who use these resources are inextricably linked and can only be sustained in productive, well-governed, and well-balanced fisheries managed holistically at the ecosystem level.},

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

In particular, the package provides a broad range of color palettes based on the HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) color space. The three HCL dimensions have been shown to match those of the human visual system very well, thus facilitating intuitive selection of color palettes through trajectories in this space. Using the HCL color model general strategies for three types of palettes are implemented: (1) Qualitative for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available. (2) Sequential for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e., going from high to low (or vice versa). (3) Diverging for coding ordered/numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes. To aid selection and application of these palettes the package also contains scales for use with ggplot2, shiny (and tcltk) apps for interactive exploration, visualizations of palette properties, accompanying manipulation utilities (like desaturation and lighten/darken), and emulation of color vision deficiencies.},

This paper explores the spatial patterns and characteristics of maritime accidents on a global scale. Maritime accident data dating from 2003 to 2018 from the Marine Casualties and Incidents (MCI) module of the Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) was collected and manipulated and descriptive analyses were conducted subsequently to obtain the overall profile of global maritime accidents. Geospatial techniques of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and K-means clustering method were introduced and parameters specifically used in this study were identified. These geospatial techniques were utilized to a) create a number of KDE maps of global maritime accidents, and b) subdivide these accidents into six classes and profile characteristics of maritime accidents within each class. Maritime accidents are more likely to occur around the United Kingdom, Denmark, Singapore, and Shanghai of China. This may be due to the large cargo volume, the high density of routes, the poor geographical conditions of the sea area and the poor climate conditions in these areas. Distributions of maritime accidents by time, initial event, and ship type are found to be diverse in different accident classes.},

In the 1940s, sea lam- prey began to devastate the fisheries, an effect that has not been fully countered. Overfishing, nonnative species, declining nutrient levels, and chemical pollution have contributed to reduced catches. Court decisions in the United States and Canada during the past thirty years have awarded a sizable share of commercial fishing rights to Native North Americans for their own support and sustenance. The Lake Erie yellow perch and walleye fishery, based mainly in Ontario, is the most successful commercial fishing oper- ation in the region.
