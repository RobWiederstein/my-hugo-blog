# [Overview](#overview)
 
 `shiny` applications are a great way to engage a reader.  They allow a person to interact with an application by entering inputs. The applications  require some organization and can range from the simple to extremely complex.

# [Background](#background)

There are a lot of places to find help in writing a first application in shiny.  (The `shiny` package must be installed first!)  Two places to start are Rstudio's [tutorials](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) and Hadley Wickham's new book, "[Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org)." The main idea behind this exercise was to design an app that took a viewer input and predicted the outcome using a mathmatical model.

# [Data and model](#data)

R comes loaded with some illustrative and easy datasets.  For this app, the `cars` dataset was used and is among the simplest datasets to understand. From the help page, "the data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s."  Early automobiles were powered by small engines and the top speed in the dataset is 25 miles per hour.

# [Results](#results)

Here's the application inserted into an `<iframe>` in my blog post:

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

The application's simplicity is deceptive.  The basic structure allows for future modeling that includes more variables and methods. Or in other words, it can be scaled to other problems that are more complex. Additionally, it allows a user to explore and see the data.
