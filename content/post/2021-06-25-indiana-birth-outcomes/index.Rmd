# [Overview](#overview)


# [Background](#background)


# [Data and model](#data)

The variables in the birth outcomes dataset were transformed so the values were comparable. It was assumed that the data was normally distributed and they were scaled, ie. the mean was subtracted and then divided by the standard deviation, by column.

## Correlation heatmap

```{r plot-correlogram}

widgetframe::frameWidget(
        heatmaply_cor(
        cor(df.1),
        xlab = "Features",
        ylab = "Features",
        k_col = 2,
        k_row = 2
        ),
        height = 600
)

```

## Heatmap

The heatmap is scaled by column.
```{r plot-heatmap}
#build heatmap
library(heatmaply)
widgetframe::frameWidget(heatmaply(df.1, scale = "column"), height = 600)
```
