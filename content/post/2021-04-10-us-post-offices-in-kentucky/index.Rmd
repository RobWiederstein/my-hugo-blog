summary: Data can yield new insights and enrich our understanding of history.  A new book by historian Cameron Blevins takes the location of U.S. post offices from 1639 to 2000 and plots them on a map by date of their establishment. The visual display shows the expansion of the American colonies westward.

# [Introduction](#intro)

This project is a derivative of the U.S. Post Offices dataset by Cameron Blevins & Richard W. Helbock.  It contains the records of 166,140 post offices spanning from 1639 to 2000. Background for the Blevins-Helbock effort can be found on their [website](https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/) and the new book, [Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/paper-trails-9780190053673?cc=us&lang=en&), was recently published by Oxford Press. The only change for this post is that the dataset was filtered or subset to just Kentucky post offices.
(Describe the problem.)

# [Background](#background)

The dataset is hosted at [Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NUKCNA). The `R` code is in a github [repository](https://github.com/cblevins/us-post-offices) maintained by Cameron Blevins.
