summary: By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as
  its summary and stores it into the `.Summary` page variable for use in your templates.
  You may customize the summary length by setting `summaryLength` in your site configuration
  *or* you can set it in the front matter.

# [Overview](#overview)

I just learned about the R trelliscope package. The question was whether a trelliscope widget could be embedded into a github page.  The widget could be embedded into this blog by first creating a separate repository and then inserting an iframe on the blog post.

# [Step 1 - Create Repo](#create-repo)

The address for the repository is [here](https://github.com/RobWiederstein/trelliscope). The key is the script within the `./R` folder.

# [Step 2 - Create Trelliscope Plot](#trell-plot)

This code was taken from the "Getting Started" [page](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/articles/trelliscopejs.html) of the package's documentation.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
qplot(year, lifeExp, data = gapminder) +
        xlim(1948, 2011) + ylim(10, 95) + theme_bw() +
        facet_trelliscope(~ country + continent, nrow = 2, ncol = 7, width = 300)
```


# [Step 3 - Save Widget to Docs](#widget-docs)

Create a `./docs` folder.  `dir.create("./docs")` should work.  The place where I struggled was collecting and saving the widget.  The files are kept in the temporary directory.  The code was included in the issues thread of the package. (You can find it [here](https://github.com/hafen/trelliscopejs/issues/24).)

The strategy was to copy the files, libraries and directories generated from the package and place them in the docs folder.  That was accomplished with the code below:

```{r, eval=F, include=T, echo=T}
trell_files <- list.files("/tmp/gap", full.names = T)

file.copy(from = trell_files,
          to = "./docs",
          recursive = T)
```


# [Step 4 - Add Docs Folder to gh-pages](#gh-pages)

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./one.png")
```

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./two.png")
```

```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./three.png")
```

# [Step 5 - Add iframe](#add-iframe)

Find the url address where GitHub published the page and insert it into the `src` attribute.


```{html, echo=T, eval=F}
<iframe src="https://robwiederstein.github.io/trelliscope/#display=by_country_continent&nrow=2&ncol=7&arr=row&pg=1&labels=country&sort=country;asc&filter=&sidebar=&fv=" width=600, height=400 title="Trelliscope Plot"></iframe>
```

<iframe src="https://robwiederstein.github.io/trelliscope/#display=by_country_continent&nrow=2&ncol=7&arr=row&pg=1&labels=country&sort=country;asc&filter=&sidebar=&fv=" width=600, height=400 title="Trelliscope Plot"></iframe>

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

The trelliscope package can provide insight on high-dimensional data. I'm really interested to see if it will work into a modeling workflow where the performance metrics are faceted with the different models. Something to experiment with in the future.
