summary: Code highlighting, when done well, is subtle.  It allows for readers to distinguish between key parts of the code like text and numbers.  The easier it is to read, the easier it is to find potential mistakes.

# Dr Seuss
a <- 1:2
fish.number <- paste(a, "fish", sep ="_")

```{r plot-mtcars, fig.align="center", fig.cap="A plot constructed with `ggplot2`."}
data(mtcars)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp,mpg, group = factor(cyl), color = factor(cyl)))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + ggtitle("Mtcars")
p
```
