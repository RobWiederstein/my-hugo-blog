summary: I've been piping code with dplyr for several years now.  But because I use it so often, I thought it was time for a refresher and some renewed investigation.  Sometimes, revisiting a topic can help break me out of a programming funk.  And sure enough, some new methods were discovered.

# [Introduction](#intro)

The `magrittr` package allows for the piping of R code.  It is to be given a strong French pronuniciation according to `vignette("magrittr")`. The package was named tongue-in-cheek after the artist Rene' Magritte.  As Magritte's painting of a pipe was not an actual pipe, neither is magrittr's operator `%>%` an actual pipe.  Rather it is a convenient way for code to be written from left to right without the nesting of functions or the creation of temporary variables. Nesting of functions is confusing and temporary variables clutter up the global environment. Using `magrittr`, `f(x)` is the equivalent of `x %>% f()` and `x %>% f(.)` where dot "." is the  placeholder for "x".

```{r magrittr-load}
#load library
library(magrittr)
```


## Assignment

Some disfavor the use of `magrittr` for assignment, preferring the traditional `<-`.

```{r assign-common}
# More common way to assign
x <- 10 %>% divide_by(2)
print(x)
```

```{r assign-rare}
# Less common
env <- environment()
"x" %>% assign(5, envir = env) %>% print

```


## When to use

Use pipes if you have (1) shorter than 10 steps, (2) a single input or output, and (3) simple dependencies.

## Argument Placeholder

From the magrittr tidyverse page cited below, here are two examples of using the "." as an argument placeholder:

-   `x %>% f(y, .) is equivalent to f(y, x)`
-   `x %>% f(y, z = .) is equivalent to f(y, z = x)`


# [Operators - 4](#operators)

The only operator that I've used consistently is the first one.

## `%>%`

```{r pipe-symbol}
# As described above
10 %>% divide_by(5)
```


## `%T>%`

Also referred to as the "t-pipe," it is helpful to determine the output in a series of chained commands.

```{r t-pipe-demo-1}
# Note the 'NULL'
rnorm(100) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 2) %>%
  plot() %>%
  str()
```

```{r t-pipe-demo-2}
#Note the matrix output
rnorm(100) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 2) %T>%
  plot() %>%
  str()
```


## `%$%` 

```{r piping-dataframe, eval = T}
car_data <- 
        mtcars %>%
        subset(hp > 100) %>%
        aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = ., FUN = . %>% mean %>% round(2)) %>%
        transform(kpl = mpg %>% multiply_by(0.4251)) %>%
        print
```

## `%<>%`

The above symbol is used for assignment, though disfavored.

```{r piping-assignment, eval=F}
# data(LakeHuron)--lake depth
LakeHuron %<>% head(3) %>% print
```



# [Functions](#functions)

A function can be created by piping.

## Unary Functions

```{r unary-functions}
# Unary functions
f <- . %>% head(3)
chickwts %>% f(.)
```

## Lambda Functions

Functions can be defined and executed within piped code.

### Long-hand Notation

```{r long-lambda, eval = F}
car_data %>%
(function(x) {
  if (nrow(x) > 2) 
    rbind(head(x, 1), tail(x, 1))
  else x
})
```

### Shorthand Notation

```{r short-lambda, eval = F}
car_data %>%
{ 
  if (nrow(.) > 0)
    rbind(head(., 1), tail(., 1))
  else .
}
```
# Aliases

Aliases can greatly improve the readibility of your code.  They can be found with the help command: `?magrittr::extract`. I'm frequently converting numbers to percentages.

```{r alias-pct}
.345 %>% multiply_by(100) %>% round(2) %>% paste0("%")
```

# [Examples](#examples)

## `mtcars` 

There are at least two things within the code that are not obvious, at least to me.  First, the piping operator `%>%` is being used within the functions themselves, instead of just the end of the line.  Second, the `aggregate` function contains a nested unary function `FUN = . %>% mean %>% round(2)`.

```{r example-vignette, eval = T}
# magrittr vignette
car_data <- 
  mtcars %>%
  subset(hp > 100) %>%
  aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = ., FUN = . %>% mean %>% round(2)) %>%
  transform(kpl = mpg %>% multiply_by(0.4251)) %>%
  print
```


```{r example-mtcars-2}
mtcars %>%
        tibble(.) %>%
        tidyr::drop_na() %>% 
        mutate(type = rownames(mtcars)) %>%
        filter(!grepl('^A|L', type)) %>%
        filter(am == 0) %>%
        select(cyl, mpg) %>%
        group_by(cyl) %>%
        summarize(avg_mpg = mpg %>% mean() %>% round(0)) %>%
        arrange(-cyl) %>%
        set_colnames(c("cylinder", "avg_mpg"))
```

## `starwars`

Use `data(starwars)`. Examples from the `vignette("dplyr")`.

```{r example-starwars-1}
starwars %>% filter(skin_color == "light", eye_color == "brown")
```

```{r example-starwars-2}
library(kableExtra)
starwars %>%
        select(name, height, mass, birth_year, sex, species, homeworld) %>%
        filter(species == "Droid") %>%
        arrange(desc(height)) %>%
        slice_head(n = 4) %>%
        kbl()

        
```





## `babynames`

This example was taken from R-bloggers post written by Stefan Milton, the author of the `magrittr` package. The post is included in the acknowledgements.

```{r example-babynames-1}
library(babynames)
babynames %>% 
    filter(name %>% substr(1, 3) %>% equals("Ste")) %>% 
    group_by(year, sex) %>% 
    summarize(total = sum(n)) %>%
    qplot(year, total, color = sex, data = ., geom = "line") %>%
    add(ggtitle('Names starting with "Ste"')) %>% 
    print
```

# [Conditional Piping](#conditional)

Making the flow of the pipe condition was the subject of this stackoverflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30604107/r-conditional-evaluation-when-using-the-pipe-operator).

```{r conditional-pipe-1}
x <- 1
y <- T
x %>% 
add(1) %>% 
 {if(y) add(.,1) else .}
```

```{r conditional-pipe-2}
library(purrr)
1:10 %>%
  when(
    sum(.) <=   x ~ sum(.),
    sum(.) <= 2*x ~ sum(.)/2,
    ~ 0,
    x = 60
  )
```

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

It appears that base R has included its own pipe `|>` in a development version, thus making the `magrittr` package obsolete in future R versions. This was [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_eDHNVceCU&t=4082s) at the 2020 useR Conference.   Piping is used widely in  many languages and one could reasonably expect that, aside from syntax, the development `|>` pipe would function similarly to magrittr's `%>%` pipe.  Although to be clear, it's not a real pipe either! Happy piping!
