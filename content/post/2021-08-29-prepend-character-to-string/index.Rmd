summary: With the ubiquitous "FIPS" codes, there is no consistency in how they are formatted.  It seems like on every project, the merge is dependent upon the format matching in the datasets and then I've usually got a mess on my hands.  A missing "0" is often the problem.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'blogdown'
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=T,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=T
)
```

```{r set-ggplot-theme-defaults, include = F}
#from ggthemes
library(ggplot2); theme_set(ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

```{r define-color-palette, include = F, eval = T}
# color blind friendly palette from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#000000")
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

# [Overview](#overview)

As an illustration, FIPS codes will often look like this where the lengths of the strings are different. Some datasets will have the zero in front, while other will not. Sometimes, the problem isn't how the data was formatted, but how the analyst imports it.

```{r intro}
df <- tibble(fips = c("1000", "01000"))
df
```
```{r example-data, include=F}
write.csv(df, file = "./example.csv", row.names = F)
```
 
This wreaks havoc on your project when you go to merge.

# Strategy 1 - Set column type

One strategy to dealing with this problem is to read in the data as character so that the formatting is clear.  Otherwise, the function will just drop the leading zeros and convert the column to an integer. For example, in the `data.table` package, the code might look like:

```{r, import-solutions, eval = F}
utils::read.csv(file = file, colClasses = "character")
#or
data.table::fread(input = input, colClasses = "character")
```

# Strategy 2 - the `readr` package

I tried out the `readr` package for this problem and it correctly converted the example to a character string and retained the leading zero.

```{r readr, eval=F}
readr::read_csv(file = file)
```

# Strategy 3 - the "Hacky Way"

I'm embarrased to admit that this was some code I routinely used in projects. And I cringe looking at it.  The line of code was interrupting a readable `magrittr` pipe. (Check out the new pipe `|>`). There is a better, more elegant solution.

```{r old-solution}
df$fips[which(nchar(df$fips)==4)] <- paste0("0", df$fips[which(nchar(df$fips)==4)])
df
```

# Strategy 4 - The Elegant Way

```{r strategy-stringr}
library(stringr)
df %>% 
  mutate(fips = str_pad(fips, width = 5, side = "left", pad = "0"))
```


# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

The best strategy is to avoid this problem in the first place.  Import the data correctly.  Importing all data as character first allows you to see the data as it is without getting transformed by an import package.  The next best strategy is to use `str_pad` in the `stringr` package.  It makes for readable code and describes what occurred.  Check the Stackoverflow post, "[How to add leading zeros?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5812493/how-to-add-leading-zeros/5816779#5816779)", for additional ideas.

Sometimes the hardest part of coding is knowing what the best search term is.  I wished I'd used the term "pad" and I could've avoided years of hacky code. Ugh.
