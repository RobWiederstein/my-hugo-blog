  caption: Lists are difficult to convert to a dataframe when they have unequal lengths.
repo: ~
summary: Lists as a data type can be confusing but also useful.  They can hold data of different types and lengths, making them versatile.  When dealing with lists, it is important to know whether it is a named, nested, and the length of the elements. This post deals with converting a list to a dataframe when it has unequal lengths.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'blogdown',
      'tidyverse',
      'rlist',
      'purrr'
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=T,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=F
)
```

```{r set-ggplot-theme-defaults, include = F}
#from ggthemes
library(ggplot2); theme_set(ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

```{r define-color-palette, include = F, eval = T}
# color blind friendly palette from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#000000")
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

# Create a Named List

```{r, echo = T}
my.l <- list()
my.l[[1]] <- list(categories = "R", tags = "list")
my.l[[2]] <- list(categories = "R", tags = c("list", "dataframe"))
names(my.l) <- c("post_1", "post_2")
```

# Generate error

Several methods for converting lists to dataframe can be found in this stackoverflow [question.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4227223/convert-a-list-to-a-data-frame).  However, when the method is applied to the above list it generates an error because the 'tags' variable has one value in `post_1` and two values in  `post_2`.  The error reads, "invalid list argument: all variables should have the same length."  This is a common problem when scraping webpages where the `html_nodes` function will sometimes be 'greedy' and include multiple values from a page. Others have noted the problem when an api call is made and the response is returned with missing values.


```{r generate-error, echo=T, error=T}
# Many potential solutions
do.call(rbind.data.frame, my.l)
```

# [Simple Solution](#simple)

```{r rbindlist-solution, echo = T}
data.table::rbindlist(my.l, fill=TRUE)
```

# [Not-so-simple Solution](#solution)

```{r solution, echo=T, warning = F}
#combine with info from list page
new.l <-rapply(my.l, function(x) paste(x, collapse = "|"), how='replace')
#fast
dt <- data.table::rbindlist(new.l)
dt$names <- names(new.l)
dt
```

# Separate Rows

```{r, separate-rows, echo = T}
dt %>% tidyr::separate_rows(tags, sep = "\\|")
```

# Separate Columns

```{r separate-cols, echo = T}
dt %>% tidyr::separate(tags, into = c("tag_1", "tag_2"), sep ="\\|")
```
