summary: You can create a data dashboard in `R` using the `flexdashboard` package. In the background, there are a handful of other packages like bootstrap, bootswatch and fontawesome. The generated website did not have a footer though.  Here is a mashup of some html and css. The code was posted in a codepen repo.

# [Overview](#overview)

Flexdashboard creates slick dashboards for the presentation of data.  However, the out-of-the-box webpage didn't have a footer.  The footer relies on older versions of bootstrap and it displays differently in codepen than in the "Indiana Early Childhood" [dashboard](https://robwiederstein.github.io/early_childhood/)

Ideally, a footer should complement and match the navigation bar of the dashboard.  And it shouldn't distract from the presentation of the data.  It was a bit of a challenge to find a simple footer.

# [Yaml Frontmatter](#frontmatter)

The code was used in the Indiana Early Childhood [repo](https://github.com/RobWiederstein/early_childhood) and the files are `./my-css-rules.css` and `./includes/footer.html` . The YAML frontmatter for the flexdashboard looks like this:

```{r yaml-frontmatter, eval=F, echo = T}
