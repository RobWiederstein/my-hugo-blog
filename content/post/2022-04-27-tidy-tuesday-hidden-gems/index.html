<h1><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>Begun in 2018, “tidy Tuesday” releases a dataset weekly and challenges the R community to provide insight, doing what data analysts do. For the week of April 26, the challenge was the “Kaggle Hidden Gems” dataset. “Hidden gems” are items that are good, but unrecognized or overlooked by others. In this same spirit, Martin Henze of Heads or Tails finds and promotes three underrated notebooks (formerly “kernels”) that he believes are deserving of a wider audience. The Kaggle Hidden Gems dataset is comprised of 300 notebooks compiled over 100 episodes.</p>

<p>The original dataset is twelve columns and 300 observations:</p>

<p>The most interesting variables were the <code>title</code> and Martin Henze’s <code>review</code>. These variables were comprised of text so I went in search of some continuous variables and potentially categorical ones too. The note’s field also had some interesting items. At regular intervals, users got to choose outstanding notebooks.</p>
</div>
<div id="feature-creation" class="section level1">
<h1><a href="#feature-creation">Feature Creation</a></h1>
<p>With some wrangling, additional features were constructed: (1)<code>title_length</code> in words; (2) <code>review_length</code> in words; (3) <code>special</code> for notebooks chosen for a special milestone; (4) <code>community</code> for notebooks chosen by users; (6) <code>sentiment_afinn</code> for a sentiment score on the review; (7) <code>frequency</code> the number of notebooks submitted by a single author; (8) <code>prior_submission</code> a logical value for users that submitted more than one notebook and (9) a <code>link</code> for the actual Kaggle notebook.</p>

<div id="sentiment-indicator" class="section level1">
<h1><a href="#sentiment-indicator">Sentiment Indicator</a></h1>
<p>The sentiment indicator was created using the <code>tidytext</code> package and following the methodology described in <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html">Text Mining with R–Chapter 2</a> by Julia Silge and David Robinson. Text mining can be used to provide the “emotional content” of a text programmatically. Here, the <code>AFINN</code> sentiment dictionary was applied to the review field. Words are assigned a score between -5 and 5. Illustrating the extreme sentiment within the dictionary yields the following examples:</p>
<div id="words-of-negative-sentiment" class="section level2">
<h2>Words of Negative Sentiment</h2>
<pre><code># A tibble: 10 × 2
   word          value
   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
 1 bastard          -5
 2 bastards         -5
 3 bitch            -5
 4 bitches          -5
 5 cock             -5
 6 cocksucker       -5
 7 cocksuckers      -5
 8 cunt             -5
 9 motherfucker     -5
10 motherfucking    -5</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="words-of-positive-sentiment" class="section level2">
<h2>Words of Positive Sentiment</h2>
<pre><code># A tibble: 5 × 2
  word         value
  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
1 breathtaking     5
2 hurrah           5
3 outstanding      5
4 superb           5
5 thrilled         5</code></pre>
<p>“Dictionary-based methods like the ones we are discussing find the total sentiment of a piece of text by adding up the individual sentiment scores for each word in the text,” according to Silge and Robinson. The individual word scores were then summarized by their title resulting in the <code>sentiment_afinn</code> variable. The <code>afinn</code> dictionary contains 2,477 words and “NA” was returned on 87 of the 300 entries. Presumably, 87 reviews did not contain any words within the dictionary.</p>

<h1><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h1>
<p>All of the 300 notebooks were considered to be overlooked and among the best. There was very little correlation among the variables, but sentiment tended to be higher where Martin Henze was familiar with an author’s past work. It could also mean that Kagglers’ notebook skills increased with additional submissions. By creating the plot and table, I have a nice index of outstanding Kaggle notebooks to consult in the future.</p>
