# [Overview](#overview)

The post uses the data from the [Immigration Policy Tracking Project](https://immpolicytracking.org/home/), a project of Professor Lucas Guttentag, with the assistance of Stanford and Yale law students. The post explores the volume and type of changes in immigration policies of the U.S. during President Trump's administration.

# [Background](#background)

Beginning in January of 2017, Professor Guttentag began compiling the different changes in administration policy with regards to immigration.[@guttentagImmigrationPolicyTracking2021]  As of the date the data was scraped from the website, there have been 1064 changes. 

# [Data and model](#data)

The data for the project was scraped from the website using `rvest`. @R-rvest

# [Results](#results)

## Plot Policy Changes by Type

```{r plot-imm-actions, out.width="100%"}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
df.1 <-
        df %>%
        mutate(month = month(date_ann), year = year(date_ann)) %>%
        group_by(month, year) %>%
        mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
        arrange(year, month)
df.1 <- df %>% 
        select(date_ann, action, n) %>%
        group_by(month = floor_date(date_ann, unit = "month"), action) %>%
        summarize(total = sum(n))
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(df.1, aes(x = month, y = total, group = action, fill = action))
p <- p + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
p <- p + scale_x_date(NULL, date_labels = "%b %y", breaks = "year")
p <- p +scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent")
p <- p + ggtitle("U.S. Immigration Policy by Action")
p <- p + labs(subtitle = "Jan. 2017 -- Jan. 2021",
              caption = "Source: Immigration Policy Tracking Project")
p <- p + ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
p
```

## Plot Google Search Volume

```{r plot-google-searches, out.width="100%"}
input <- "https://dl.dropbox.com/s/gqgnzwxr9l11e8p/2020-04-02-google-search-immigration.csv?dl=0"
df.i <- data.table::fread(input = input, skip = 2)
colnames(df.i) <- c("date", "imm")
df.i$date <- as.Date(df.i$date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
df.i <-
  df.i %>%
  dplyr::filter(date > "2017-01-01" & date <"2021-01-01")
#plot
p <- ggplot(df.i, aes(x = date, y = imm, colour = "mention"))
p <- p + geom_line(color = cbPalette[2])
p <- p + scale_x_date(NULL, date_labels = "%b %y", breaks = "year")
p <- p + ggtitle("Google Searches for 'Immigration'")
p <- p + labs(subtitle = "Jan. 2017 -- Jan. 2021",
              caption = "Source: https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US")
p <- p + tidyquant::geom_ma(n = 4, colour = "black",
                            linetype = "solid")
p <- p + ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
p
```



# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

The Trump administration made a consistent effort after the first couple of months in office to change existing immigration policies.  The policy initiatives seemed to spike at and around the November, 2020, election for the presidency.  Without a longer timeline, it is difficult to say how the Trump administration differed from previous adminisrations at least in terms of the volume and types of changes.
