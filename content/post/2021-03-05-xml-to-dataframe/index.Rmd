summary: Everytime I run into a file with an `.xml` extension, I cringe.  Though, admittedly, it's a file format that you have to be familiar with when it comes to sending and receiving data over the web. `R` has a package `xlm2` to assist in the conversion of nested data to tabular data.

)
lapply(x, library, character.only = T)
```

```

## Overview

The task here is to take an easy and short `xml` file and convert it to a dataframe.  The `xml2` package was specifically designed for the task and is the successor to the `xml` package.

## Background

### Sanity Checks

Let's face it:  you wouldn't be on this page if you could've figured it out using W3schools or the `R` help menu. Let's start with some super basic stuff. Have you opened the `.xml` file using a browser?  Do that first and see if you can get a sense of how the data is organized.  Second, open the xml file in a linter and see if it's formatted correctly.  (Here's an [example](https://xmllint.com)) I've lost a ton of time double checking code only to figure out that some `.json` was missing a "}".  Finally, open it in a good text editor and beautify the code.  (I use Atom.)  My last project, I "peeled" the outer layers of the onion to get at the data.  It was hacky and lacked reproducibility, but it worked.

### Definitions

First, it's important to get some defintions first. (W3schools has a really helpful set of [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp) on the topic.)  A "node" in general and speaking in a broad way is an HTML element.

**DOM (Document Object Model)** - a tree structure that represents the HTML of the website, and every HTML element is a "node".

**Element Nodes** - model the actual HTML elements in the document.

**Attribute Nodes** - model the various attributes in the different HTML elements. Attributes include id, class, title and style.

**Text Nodes** - model the text content inside the different HTML elements.

**Root Node** - the node on the very top of the document tree, usually called the document node.

**Parent Node** - a node that has children; represents an element that has at least one other element or text nested inside it.

**Child Node** - a node that has a parent; represents an element or text that is nested inside another element. For example, a `<p>` tag is often the child of a `<div>` tag.


```{r load-more-libraries, include = F}
library(xml2)
```

### Example

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="See [DOM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) on Wikipedia", out.width = '65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("wikipedia-dom-model.png")
```

### Structure

XML structured data looks like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> #xml prologue
<root>
  <child>
    <subchild>.....</subchild>
  </child>
</root>
```

### Xpath

XPath is a syntax for defining and navigating parts of an XML document. They can be used across many languages. Xpath has over 200 functions according to W3schools.  See the W3 page for [xpath syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp).

## XML Data

All of the functions below are from the `xlm2` package and the help [page](https://xml2.r-lib.org).

```{r read-in-xml, echo = T}
#get W3 data
url <- "https://www.w3schools.com/xml/simple.xml"
# read breakfast menu
bkfst <- read_xml(x = url)
str(bkfst)
```

```{r xml-name, echo = T}
xml_name(bkfst)
```

### See XML Data Structure

```{r xml-structure, echo = T}
xml_structure(bkfst)
```


```{r xml-text, echo = T}
# see text
xml_text(bkfst)
```

### Extract XML

The real key is understanding how to define or set the "xpath" argument.


```{r get-bkfst-name, echo = T}
xml_find_all(bkfst, xpath = "//name")
```

```{r get-bkfst-price, echo = T}
xml_text(xml_find_all(bkfst, xpath = "//name"))
```

### Build table

```{r build-bkfst-table, echo = T}
library(tibble)
name <- xml_text(xml_find_all(bkfst, xpath = "//name"))
price <- xml_text(xml_find_all(bkfst, xpath = "//price"))
df <- tibble(name = name, price = price)
df
```

## Lists and XML

Lists and xml are similar and easily converted within the `xml2` package.

```{r create-nested-list, echo = T}
document <- list(root = list(parent = list(child = list(1))))
xmlDoc <- xml2::as_xml_document(document)
xml2::xml_structure(xmlDoc)
```

```{r extract-one}
xml_find_all(xmlDoc, xpath = ".//child")
```

## Conclusion

If you can get a basic understanding of html web pages and xpath syntax, then you should be able to parse xml files efficiently with `xlm2`.
