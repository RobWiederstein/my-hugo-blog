summary: Managing dependencies is required when building packages. This post reviews some common functions and strategies. It doesn't discuss including packages in the description or namespaces.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'blogdown',
      'devtools',
      'renv',
      'pak'
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=T,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=F
)
```

```{r set-ggplot-theme-defaults, include = F}
#from ggthemes
library(ggplot2); theme_set(ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

```{r define-color-palette, include = F, eval = T}
# color blind friendly palette from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#000000")
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

# [Overview](#overview)

# What packages are installed and where?

This command shows what packages you are using and where they are installed on your system.

```{r show-packages, echo =T}
devtools::loaded_packages()[1:5, ]
```

# Package Management

- from CRAN, `install.packages(pkgs = "dplyr")`.
- Development version from GitHub, `devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")`
- attach library to search path with `library("dplyr")`.
- for paths, run `devtools::loaded_packages()`
- see list of **attached** packages `search()`.
- detach is the opposite of library.  `detach(package:dplyr)`
- verify package detached `search()`
- remove package `remove.packages("dplyr")`.
- see installed packages `installed.packages()`

# The `pak` Package

As of September 2022, Posit will probably recommend `pak` as its package installation tool,  especially, for installing packages directly from GitHub.


- `pak::pkg_install("tibble")`
- `pak::pkg_install("tidyverse/tibble")`
- `pak::pkg_deps_tree("tibble")`
- `pak::pkg_deps_explain("tibble", "rlang")`
- `pak::local_install("cli")`

# Five Package States - [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/structure.html)

When you create a package, you are working on its **source** code.  An R package can be in one of five states:

- **source**. Source is the thing that is on GitHub or the raw code that a developer is creating.
        
- **bundled**. A package compressed into a single file. In R, a bundled package uses the extension `.tar.gz`.
        
- **binary**.  Like a package bundle, a binary is a single file. Binaries are either Mac (extension `.tgs`) or Windows (extension `zip`). CRAN makes binaries. A developer submits a bundle and CRAN convert it to a binary.
        
- **installed**. An installed package is a binary package that was decompressed into a package library.
        
- **in-memory**. The familiar `library(package)` command puts the package in memory and on the search path.
        
# The `renv` package

The `renv` package is the successor to `packrat` and is available in Rstudio version RStudio 2022.07.2.  When choosing to create a package, a checkbox will appear that allows for `renv` to be installed. 

```{r renv-pic}
knitr::include_graphics("./renv.png")
```


More information is available on the [website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/). I'm used to just calling `library(package)` or `package::function()`.  When using `renv` you have to install it first even though it's already in your local library.

- call `renv::init()` to begin.
- install and remove packages.
- call `renv::snapshot()`.  It saves a file `renv.lock` in the root directory that contains an inventory of the packages used.

The lockfile contents look like the code below:

```{r renv-example, eval=F, echo=T, warning=F}
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.1.3",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cran.rstudio.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "R6": {
      "Package": "R6",
      "Version": "2.5.1",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "470851b6d5d0ac559e9d01bb352b4021",
      "Requirements": []
    },
  }
}
```

# The `devtools` functions 

These are the tools from the `devtools` package that I use the most. Alot of them are available via the RStudio GUI.

-  `devtools::build()` - Build package
-  `devtools::build_rmd()` - Build a Rmarkdown files package
-  `devtools::build_site()` - Execute 'pkgdown' build_site in a package
-  `devtools::build_vignettes()` - Build package vignettes.
-  `devtools::check()` - Check a package
-  `devtools::document()` - Document a package
-  `devtools::load_all()` - Load packages
-  `devtools::spell_check()` - One I should run more!

# System Files

In building a package, I often include an rmarkdown document. The recommendation is for the document to be included in the `inst` folder. For example, the document would be included in the `inst\article\index.Rmd`.  When the package is installed, the `inst` portion is omitted, leaving `article\index.Rmd`.  Writing a function within the development version requires that it be referred to as a system file. The concept is detailed in the stackoverflow post: [How to include RMarkdown file in r package?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30377213/how-to-include-rmarkdown-file-in-r-package/30377598#30377598).

```{r system-file, eval=F, echo=T}
system.file("article", "index.Rmd", package = "myPackage")
```

# Sources of Confusion

In R, library means a collection of packages and packages means software tools. This convention is counter to other programming languages.
        

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

When a developer creates his or her own package, it will in turn rely on other packages.  Those packages will often times be outside of the `base` R package.  (Although, I've seen some amazing coding where the author limits use to just functions in the `base` package.) Where a package incorporates the use of another package, it is referred to as a dependency.  These dependencies must be explicit and inventoried.  They must even include the specific versions.  `renv` can help with that process. Also, remember that as a developer, you are writing source code and it may behave differently when it is bundled and installed in a user's local library.  Happy coding!
