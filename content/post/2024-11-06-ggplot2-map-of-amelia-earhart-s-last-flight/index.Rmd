summary: Amelia Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the world by airplane ended in tragedy. This post uses `ggplot2` to map her last flight. There were 33 stops in the journey with the most dangerous being the three spanning the Pacific Ocean.  From Lae, New Guinea, she and her navigator Fred Noonan departed and were to land at Howland Island.  They never arrived. A map was generated with `ggplot2` and shows the trip.

# [Overview](#overview)

Amelia Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the world by airplane ended in tragedy on July 2, 1937. There were 33 stops in the journey with the most dangerous being the three spanning the Pacific Ocean.  From Lae, she and her navigator Fred Noonan were to land at Howland Island.  Howland Island is approximately one kilometer wide by two kilometers long.  They never arrived. A map generated by `ggplot2` shows the trip. 

In her book *Last Flight*, Amelia Earhart noted that the trip to Howland Island was the longest hop of 2,556 miles.  The plane was stripped of as much weight as possible to maximize fuel efficiency.  Since there are no landmarks on the ocean, signals by radio wave were crucial to finding the island.  Two Coast Guard cutters were stationed along the route to aid in naviation: the Itasca and the Ontario.  The Itasca was just off the beach on the "leeward" side of the island.  Most investigators ascribe poor radio communication as the leading cause of the disappearance. In a passage that foreshadows the tragedy, Earhart writes to her husband from Lae: 

> "Fred Noonan has been unable, because of radio difficulties, to set his chronometers.  Any lack of knowledge of their fastness and slowness would defeat the accuracy of celestial navigation.  Howland is such a small spot in the Pacific that every aid to locating it must be available." [@earhart_last_2009]

# Step 1 - Build Earhart's Flight Path

The data for the project was scraped from Wikipedia; the cities/airports were updated and geocoded; and the data was saved as a `rds` file.

```{r scrape-wikipedia, eval = F, echo = T, tidy=F}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tidygeocoder)

  rename_with(~janitor::make_clean_names(.)) %>% 
  rename(departure_city = departure_city_140,
         notes = notes_141)-> stops
# pull cities
c(stops$departure_city, stops$arrival_city) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(old_address = value)  -> locations_old
# geocode
tribble(
  ~old_address,                             ~new_address,

# Step 2 - Create `sf` objects

The next step is to create the `sf` objects for the map.  The basemap is from a GitHub repository that holds historical maps.  This particular map is from 1938, the year after Amelia Earhart's trip and shows national boundaries as they existed then.

```

# Step 3 - Plot the Main Map

```{r main-map, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world) +
  geom_sf(data = bbox, col = "black", alpha = 0, lwd = .35) +
  geom_sf(data = cities, col = "steelblue", size = .75) +
  geom_sf_text(data = cities, aes(label = city),
               col = "black",
               nudge_y = 3.5,
               nudge_x = 3,
               size = 1.75) +
  geom_sf(data = flight_path, col = "steelblue") +
  geom_sf(data = missing_path, col = "steelblue", linetype = "dotted") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-180, 180), 
           ylim = c(-50, 51),
           expand = F,
           label_graticule = "SE") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "", breaks = seq(-180, 180, 60)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "", breaks = c(-40, -20, 0, 20, 40)) +
  theme_bw() -> main
```



# Step 4 - Plot Howland Island

```{r howland-map, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = hi, col = "steelblue", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_sf(data = itasca, col = "black", fill = "black", size = .5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-176.7, -176.5), 
           ylim = c(.7, .9),
           expand = F) +
  geom_sf_text(data = hi, mapping = aes(label = name), 
                nudge_y = -.04,
                nudge_x = .02,
                size = 1.2) +
  geom_sf_text(data = itasca, mapping = aes(label = name), 
                nudge_y = .02,
                nudge_x = 0,
                size = 1.2) +
theme_void() +
theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      panel.background = element_rect(colour = "black", linewidth = 1)) -> howland
```

# Step 5 - Combine the Maps

```{r combine-maps, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
main +
  annotation_custom(
    grob = ggplotGrob(howland),
    xmin = -160,
    xmax = 100,
    ymin = -30,
    ymax = 0
  ) 
```


# Final Map

Ultimately, the labels were difficult to place.  There were a number of packages that were attempted like `ggrepel` but the easiest was to use `ggplot::geom_sf_text` and then export as a pdf.  The labels were then moved in Inkscape.  The final map is shown below.

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./earhart_trip.jpg")
```

# Conclusion

This project proved to be a challenging effort, largely because of the number of iterations required for the map to look presentable.
