  caption: Iterating and extracting from a list
repo: ~
summary: This post is about how to iterate over and extract from a list.  It begins with the function lapply() since many people are familiar with it and then expounds on functions in the purrr package.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
    "devtools", # for session info
    "ggthemes", # for plots
    "blogdown",
    "purrr"
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
    if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
    library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    comment = "",
    fig.width = 6,
    fig.asp = .8,
    fig.align = "center",
    message = F,
    error = F,
    warning = F,
    tidy = F,
    comment = "",
    cache = F,
    dev = "svg",
    echo = F
)
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

# [Overview](#overview)

This post addresses a common task of iterating over a list. Standard iteration relies heavily on the "apply" family of function in the `base` package.  The method for iterating over a list in the base package is `base::lapply()` and the newer, tidyverse method is `purrr::map()`. The two are similar but `purrr` allows for more flexibility and its syntax is more concise and consistent. 

The post will show how to iterate over a list, convert a list to a vector, extract elements from a list by both name and position, flatten a list, transpose  a list and simplify a list.  The emphasis and goal is to incorporate the newer `purrr` functions into future workflows.  (After package install, see `?purrr::map` for more information).

One quote to remember as you begin this tutorial is from "R for Data Science": "[Y]ou should never feel bad about using a for loop instead of a map function. The map functions are a step up a tower of abstraction, and it can take a long time to get your head around how they work."

# [Key terms](#key-terms)

In addition to the key terms in List Basics-Part 01, the following terms are also useful:

- a **named function** is one of the form:
```{r named-function, echo=T, eval=F}
addition_function <- function(x) {
    x + 1
}
```

-  **lambda** or **anonymous functions** are ones that are not important enough to be named, but instead are created "on-the-fly" like `function(.x) .x + 1`. Lambda/anonymous functions are considered to be verbose in R.  

- a **purrr-style lambda function, formula** is a convenience or shortcut function taking the form `~ .x + 1`.  It is available for use in the `purrr` package. This form should be reserved for short and simple functions.

# [map() distinguished from lapply()](#distinguished)

While `map()` and `lapply()` are similar , the `map()` function accepts a purrr-style lambda function where the `lapply()` function does not.

## The lapply() method

```{r lapply-method-function, echo=T}
# apply function
list(letters[5:9]) |> lapply(paste0, "<==")
```

```{r lapply-method-anonymous, echo=T}
# apply anonymous function
list(letters[5:9]) |> lapply(function(x) paste0(x, "<=="))
```

```{r lapply-method-purr-style, echo = T, error=T}
# apply purr-style lambda function
list(letters[5:9]) |> lapply(~ paste0(x, "<=="))
```

a purrr-style lambda function will not work in `lapply()`.

## The map() method

A basic template for `map()` usage is `map(YOUR_LIST, YOUR_FUNCTION)` or if you're piping, it would be modified to `YOUR_LIST |> map(YOUR_FUNCTION)`.

```{r map-method-function, echo=T}
# map function
list(letters[5:9]) |> map(paste0, "<==")
```

```{r map-method-anonymous, echo = T}
# map anonymous function
list(letters[5:9]) |> map(function(x) paste0(x, "<=="))
```

```{r map-purr-style-function, echo = T}
# map purr-style lambda function
list(letters[5:9]) |> map(~ paste0(.x, "<=="))
```

Having shown the similarity between `map()` and `lapply()`, the balance of the post is dedicated to the `purrr` package.

# [List to vector](#list-to-vector)

`map()` always returns a list.  After iterating over a list with the `map()` function, the result can be returned as a user-defined data type, using the `map_lgl` (logical), `map_chr()` (character), `map_int()` (integer), `map_dbl()` (double), `map_raw()` (raw), `map_df()` (data frame), `map_dfr()` (data frame), or `map_dfc()` (data frame) functions.

## Output -- Double
```{r list-to-vector-map-dbl, echo=T}
1:3 |>
    map(~ rnorm(.x, n = 100, sd = .5)) |> # output a list
    map_dbl(mean) # output an atomic vector
```

## Output -- Character

```{r list-to-vector-map-chr, echo = T}
goldilocks <- list(mamma_bear = "bed_1", papa_bear = "bed_2", baby_bear = "bed_3")
goldilocks |>
    map_chr(~ paste0("Who's been sleeping in ", .x, "?"))
```

## Output -- Dataframe

The "c" in `map_dfc()` stands for "column", the "r" in `map_dfr()` stands for "row". (Conversion of lists to data frames and vice versa is the topic of the next post).

```{r list-to-dataframe, echo=T}
list(a = c(1, 2), b = c(3, 4)) |>
    map_dfc(~ as.data.frame(.)) |>
    setNames(c("a", "b"))
```
# [Extract element(s) from list](#extract)

## Single nested list
```{r extract-single-nested-list, echo = T}
# create
l1 <- list(list(a = 1), list(a = NULL, b = 2), list(b = 3))
l1
```

### By position

```{r extract-single-nested-list-position, echo=T}
l1 |> map_dbl(2, .default = NA)
```

### By name 

```{r extract-single-nested-list-1, echo=T}
map(l1, "a", .default = "???")
```

```{r extract-single-nested-list-2, echo=T}
l1 |> map("b", .default = NA)
```

## Multi nested list 

```{r create-multi-nested-list, echo = T}
l2 <- list(
    list(num = 1:3, let = letters[1:3]),
    list(num = 101:103, let = letters[4:6]),
    list()
)
l2
```

### By position 

```{r extract-multi-nested-list-position-1, echo=T}
l2 |> map(c(1, 3))
```

```{r extract-multi-nested-list-position-2, echo=T}
l2 |> map(c(2, 2))
```


### By name & position 

```{r extract-multi-nested-list-name-pos-1, echo=T}
l2 |> map(list("num", 3))
```

```{r extract-multi-nested-list-name-pos-2, echo=T}
l2 |> map(list("let", 1))
```

```{r extract-multi-nested-list-name-pos-3, echo=T}
l2 |> map_int(list("num", 3), .default = NA)
```

# [Flatten list](#flatten-list)

`flatten()` is similar to `unlist()`, but it only removes a single layer and returns the same type as the input.

```{r flatten-list, echo=T}
l2 |> flatten()
```

Also, a list can be subset and then flattened with `map()`.

```{r flatten-list-map, echo=T}
# flatten with map
l2 |>
    map(list("let", 1)) |>
    flatten_chr()
```

# [Transpose list](#transpose)

`transpose()` turns a list-of-lists "inside-out"; it turns a pair of lists into a list of pairs, or a list of pairs into pair of lists.

```{r transpose-list-create, echo=T}
# create list
x <- rerun(3, x = runif(1), y = runif(5))
x
```

```{r transpose-list-transpose, echo=T}
x |> transpose()
```


# [Simplify list](#simplify-list)

Use `simplify_all()` to reduce to atomic vectors where possible.

```{r simplify-all-list, echo=T}
x <- list(list(a = 1, b = 2), list(a = 3, b = 4), list(a = 5, b = 6))
x
```

Then, transpose the above list.

```{r simplify-all-transpose, echo=T}
x |> transpose()
```

Finally, simplify the list.

```{r simplify-all-simplify, echo=T}
## helpful
x |>
    transpose() |>
    simplify_all()
```


# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

You should now know how to iterate over a list, convert a list to a vector, extract elements from a list by both name and position, flatten, transpose, and simplify a list.  These are only some of the highlights within the `purrr` package and there are many more variants and functions available. Rstudio published a "must-have" [cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/purrr.pdf) for `purrr`.
