# [Overview](#overview)

As a recent visitor to Key West via ferry, I needed transportation upon my arrival.  Rental cars were expensive and it can be difficult to find parking on a crowded island.  A moped seemed like a decent alternative given its cheap cost and easy maneuvering.  But what were the safety considerations? After an internet search or two, I discovered that the Key West Police Department raised concerns about moped accidents in the past.  So I decided to do some sleuthing on my own.

# [Background](#background)

The safety of different kind of vehicles are constantly being evaluated by researchers.  And there are a variety of products available for rental or purchase.  The possibilities include things like hover boards and scooters.[@nationalhighwaytrafficsafetyadministrationTrafficSafetyFacts2021]


# [Data and model](#data)

Florida has an open data [portal](https://gis-fdot.opendata.arcgis.com). There, a [dataset](https://gis-fdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fdot::motorcycle-moped-crashes/about) regarding motorcycle and moped "crashes" is maintained. The data were collected beginning in 2012 through 2019.  The 2019 data are suspect in that crashes notably declined and its cause is unknown.
