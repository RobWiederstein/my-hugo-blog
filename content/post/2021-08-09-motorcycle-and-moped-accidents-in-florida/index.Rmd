# [Overview](#overview)

As a recent visitor to Key West via ferry, I needed transportation upon my arrival.  Cars were expensive and difficult to find parking on the crowded island.  A moped seemed like a decent alternative given its cheap cost and easy maneuvering.  But what were the safety considerations?

# [Background](#background)

Florida has an open data [portal](https://gis-fdot.opendata.arcgis.com). There, a [dataset](https://gis-fdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fdot::motorcycle-moped-crashes/about) regarding motorcycle and moped "crashes" is maintained.
