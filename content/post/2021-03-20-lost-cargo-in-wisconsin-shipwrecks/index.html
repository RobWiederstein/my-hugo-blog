caption: Lumber was the word that appeared with the greatest frequency.
summary: The Wisconsin Historical Society created a database of shipwrecks in its waters.  The shipwrecks occurred between the years 1679 and 1981.  The total number of observations with location data was 615.  A text field was included describing the cargo of the ships.  A wordcloud of the most frequently used words is created from the text field.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The data for this project comes from <a href="wisconsinshipwrecks.org">wisconsinshipwrecks.org</a>. Once put into a “tidy” format, there were twenty-nine variables.<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-wisconsinhistoricalsocietyWisconsinShipwrecks2014" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> One of the more interesting–and probably difficult to construct for the researchers–was a field entitled <code>cargo_description</code>. I was unsure what to do with it, but there were so much narrative that provides a look into shipping in the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This post, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-word-cloud-with-r-bde3e7422e8a">How to Generate Word Clouds in R</a>, was successfully followed and resulted in the ouput above. It is rare for me to be able to duplicate the methodology of another post without any problems, but it occurred here. I ended up using the <code>wordcloud2</code> package to create the output which is a widget.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The different elements in the <code>cargo_description</code> file contained brief descriptions of the contents of each ship and many were either blank or “NA.” 76.42% of the observations contained some text. The <code>cargo_description</code> variable was arranged in descending order by the number of characters within the field. The five longest are displayed below:</p>

10,000 bushels of oats, 90 tons of mill feed, 1,254 barrels of flour, 9 tons of furniture and mercanhadise, a large quantity doors and sashes, and a handful of passengers who were transferred to the Dulurth before she left Bayfield.
"“Persistent rumors concerning the Manistee’s”“other”" cargo abound, and warrant mention. On board there were allegedly 100 tons of pure copper bars, plus a large quantity of gold and silver in the ship’s strongbox. The weight of the copper, some locals speculated, was obviously a factor in the Manistee’s list - if that is what happened. This "“secret”" cargo was never definitely proven.""

Nash, Kissel and one Rollin Motor car and a stationary steam engine. At the time of the sinking the exact number of vehicles was not clear. Reports varied from "“40 Nash and Kissel cars”" to 50 automobiles to "“her decks were full of new automobiles”". Other sources claimed that there was between 19 and 50 vehicles. In actuality, at least twenty-two 1925 Nash, Kissel and the one Rollin cars have been verified by divers.
The freighter was capable of carrying 250 cars. Her gross carrying capacity was rated at 1,878.1 tons; 1,773.61 under deck and 94.49 tons within the cabin space on the upper deck.

The Phoenix possibly could have added some American passengers at her scheduled stops at Cleveland and Detroit. Record keeping was poor and the ship’s papers were lost in the fire.

<h2>Special Note</h2>
<p>The “Phoenix” bears the infamous record of most fatalities in the Wisconsin shipwrecks database. Total deaths in the shipwreck database are 823. To understand the magnitude the tradgedy, the chart below shows the number of <code>lives</code> lost by ship. According to a wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Phoenix_(1845)">article</a>, the number of lives lost on the Phoenix was estimated to be much higher than the 190 reported.</p>
