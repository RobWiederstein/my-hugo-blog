# [Overview](#overview)

Professor Bryan's full quote on list inspection is: "[l]ist inspection is very important and also fairly miserable. Before you can apply a function to every element of a list, you’d better understand the list!" Originally, I didn't think this post was necessary until I ran into some large lists and also discovered some nice features in the Rstudio development environment.  

Additionally, Professor Bryan also created a tutorial dedicated to inspecting lists [here](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls00_inspect-explore.html). For the rest of the post, we'll be trying out functions using the `gh_repos` list in the `repurrrsive` package. In the past, lists made me miserable because I couldn't see what I was working with in the environment window.

# [Basics](#basics)

A StackOverflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32618369/is-there-a-way-to-view-a-list) was asked about how to view a list. The following functions were gleaned from the question. Traditional commands to inspect an object work on a list like `str()`, `head()`, and `summary()`.

```{r view-list, echo=TRUE}
library(repurrrsive)
# load
data("gh_repos")
# check
is.list(gh_repos)
```

```{r gh-repos-str, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#evaluation omitted due to length
str(gh_repos); head(gh_repos); summary(gh_repos)
```

The return from `str()` function can be narrowed through use of string subsetting. For example, `str(gh_repos[[1]]` will only return information from the first element of the `gh_repos` data. A second way to limit output from the `str()` function is through use of the `max.level` argument and the `list.len` argument.  

```{r gh-repos-str-narrow, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
str(gh_repos[[1]][[1]], max.level = 1, list.len = 10)
```

# [Rstudio tools](#rstudio-tools)

The Rstudio environment offers a several helpful tools. In the course of writing this, I discovered some very helpful features.

```{r str-screenshot, fig.cap="A large list.  The red arrow on the left points to the blue drop-down to see the list.  The red arrow on the right shows the magnifying glass to inspect the list."}
knitr::include_graphics("str-environment.png")
```

```{r inspection-window, fig.cap = "After clicking on the magnifying glass, a viewer window will open.  The red rectangle shows the blue dropdown boxes for further inspection of the lists."}
knitr::include_graphics("list-screen.png")
```

```{r inspection-window-arrow, fig.cap = "Clicking the green arrow will show the list elements index.  Here it is \"gh_repos[[1]][[1]][[\"id\"]]\""}
knitr::include_graphics("list-inspector-green-arrow.png")
```


# [listviewer](#listviewer)

Additionally, the package `listviewer` can assist with navigating lists though its functionality is similar to the Rstudio environment.

```{r listviewer, echo=T, eval=F}
library(listviewer)
jsonedit(gh_repos)
```

```{r listviewer-ui, fig.cap="User interface for the `listviewer` package"}
knitr::include_graphics("listviewer-user-interface.png")
```


# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Being able to manipulate and transform lists effectively requires a working knowledge of their contents.  Function commands like `str()` can be helpful but be sure to employ Rstudio's native GUI functionalities as well.  They can be a big productivity boost.
