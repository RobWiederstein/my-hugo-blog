# [Overview](#overview)

Professor Bryan's full quote on list inspection is actually that "[l]ist inspection is very important and also fairly miserable. Before you can apply a function to every element of a list, you’d better understand the list!" Originally, I didn't think this post was necessary and then I ran into some garguantuan lists and also discovered some nice features in the Rstudio development environment.  

Additionally Professor Bryan also committed to a tutorial to inspecting lists [here](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls00_inspect-explore.html) which suggest that the topic is important. For the duration, we'll be trying out the functions using the `gh_repos` list in the `repurrrsive`package. In the past lists have made me miserable because you can't see what your're working with in the environment window, a window that we'll talk about below.

# [Basics](#basics)

A StackOverflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32618369/is-there-a-way-to-view-a-list) was asked about how to view a list. The following functions were gleaned from the question. Traditional commands to inspect an object work on a list like `str()`, `head()`, and `summary()`.

```{r view-list, echo=TRUE}
library(repurrrsive)
# load
data("gh_repos")
# check
is.list(gh_repos)
```

```{r gh-repos-str, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#evaluation omitted due to length
str(gh_repos); head(gh_repos); summary(gh_repos)
```


# [Rstudio Tools](#rstudio-tools)

The Rstudio environment offers a number of helpful tools. In the course of writing this, I discovered a very helpful feature.

```{r str-screenshot, fig.cap="A large list.  The red arrow on the left points to the blue drop down to see the list.  The red arrow on the right shows the magnifying glass to inspect the list."}
knitr::include_graphics("str-environment.png")
```

```{r inspection-window, fig.cap = "After clicking on the magnifying glass, a viewer window will open.  The red rectangle shows the blue dropdown boxes for further inspection of the lists."}
knitr::include_graphics("list-screen.png")
```

```{r inspection-window-arrow, fig.cap = "Clicking the green arrow will show the list elements index.  Here it is \"gh_repos[[1]][[1]][[\"id\"]]\""}
knitr::include_graphics("list-inspector-green-arrow.png")
```


# [listviewer](#listviewer)

Additionally, the package `listviewer` can assist with navigating lists though its functionality is similar to the Rstudio environment.

```{r listviewer, echo=T, eval=F}
library(listviewer)
jsonedit(gh_repos)
```

```{r listviewer-ui, fig.cap="User interface for the `listviewer` package"}
knitr::include_graphics("listviewer-user-interface.png")
```


# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Being able to manipulate and transform lists effectively requires a working knowledge of its contents.  Function commands like `str()` can be helpful, but be sure to employ Rstudio's native GUI functionalities as well.  They can be a big productivity boost.
