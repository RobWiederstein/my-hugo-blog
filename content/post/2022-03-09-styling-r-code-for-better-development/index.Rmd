summary: As a script grows in both length and complexity, it can become a maze unless there are well-marked paths to aid understanding. Consistent styling is crucial to being able to debug problematic code and can help one find the way.  This post offers some tips.

```{r load-packages, cache = F, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'blogdown',
      'styler',
      'grkstyle',
      'tidyverse'
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=F,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=F
)
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

# [Overview](#overview)

As so eloquently stated in the tidyverse style guide, "Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread." This post will (1) explain the consensus around styling R code, (2) teach how to use the `styler` and `grkstyle` packages, (4) show how to create a keyboard shortcut, and (5) develop a GitHub workflow for styling `R` code.

# [Background](#background)

Inconsistent styling can result in confusion and delayed comprehension. It may further limit a program's reuse, maintainability, and open-source collaboration.[@yenComputationalAnalysisDynamics2019] At least two packages are popular in styling `R` code. This post discusses the `styler` package.  (Another popular package is the `formatR` package by Yihui Xie and its website can be found [here](https://yihui.org/formatr/)).

There are at least three different style guides for programming in R:  [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html), the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), and [Bioconductor Coding Style Guide](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/coding-style/).[@yenComputationalAnalysisDynamics2019]

In 2019, three researchers released a paper that examined how `R` code was styled.  Their analysis included 20 years of CRAN packages and over 94 million lines of code.  They made the following consensus-based recommendations:

>
-  Use lower Camel (lowerCamel) or snake case (snake_case)
-  Use <- to assign, don’t use =
-  Add a space after commas
-  Use TRUE/FALSE, don’t use T/F
-  Put open curly bracket on the same line then a newline 
-  Use double quotation marks for strings
-  Add spaces around infix operators (i.e. =, +, -, <-)
-  Don’t terminate lines with a semicolon
-  Don’t explicitly type integers (i.e. 1L) 
-  Put closed curly bracket on a separate line
-  Don’t use the tab to indent

# [`styler`](#styler)

The `styler` package in R is designed to style R code. [@R-styler]. You can start by installing the package and loading it into the namespace.

```{r load-pkg, eval=FALSE, echo = T, include=TRUE}
#install package
install.packages("styler")
library(styler)
```

The package [overview](https://styler.r-lib.org/index.html) details its main functions: `style_pkg()`, `style_file()` and `style_text()`. These functions are added to the "Addins" menu in Rstudio.  More information at `vignette(package = "styler")`.

## Unstyled

```{r styler-unstyled, eval = F, echo = T}
#example - spaces missing
readr::read_csv('./my_table.csv',col_names=c('a','b'))
```

## Styled

```{r styler-styled, eval = T, echo = T}
#example
style_text("readr::read_csv('./my_table.csv',col_names=c('a','b'))")
```
The tidyverse style guide is a sensible default for writing R code.

```{r example-tidyverse-style, echo = T}
# example tidyverse style
styler::style_text("call( 1)", style = tidyverse_style, scope = "spaces")

```

## Indentation

Space indentation is two spaces for tidyverse style.  Indentation is related to line length.  After all, a line that has multiple indentations leaves less space for the actual code.  Most style guides and linters,  like `lintr`, recommend a maximum line length of 80 characters.[@yenComputationalAnalysisDynamics2019]  Indentation and a line length margin can be set in Rstudio.

For identation, go to  Rstudio > Preferences > Code > Editing.

```{r indentation-screenshot, fig.cap="Indentation set to 6 spaces.  Note that the \"insert spaces for tab\" is checked as recommended by the study above."}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio_indent_setting.png")

```

For line-length settings, go to Rstudio > Preferences > Code > Display.

```{r line-length-screenshot, fig.cap="Margin setting at 80.  Indentation guides can also be a helpful option."}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio_margin_setting.png")
```


In production, a two-space indentation can be problematic when writing deeply nested code.  The small contrast can make it difficult for a programmer to see code flow and matching brackets/parenthesis. Indentation is a personal preference and should be set to maximize productivity. (My preference is an indentation of 6 spaces in production and then for it to be restyled consistent with tidyverse style guide of 2 when pushed to GitHub).

Indentation within the `styleR` package is via the command:

```{r styler-indent-formats, echo=T}
library(styler)
string_to_format <-
"dataset |> dplyr::group_by(some_variable) |> dplyr::summarise(
    mean(mean_some_variable=mean(some_variable)))"
styler::style_text(string_to_format, style = tidyverse_style, indent_by = 6)
```


# [`grkstyle`](#grkstyle)

Some may like even further refinement and can supplement `styler` with `grkstyle`. The `readme.md` in its repo contains the following example:

## Unstyled

```{r grkstyle-unstyled, eval = F, echo = T}
do_something_very_complicated(something = "that", requires = many,
                              arguments = "some of which may be long")
```

## Styled

```{r grkstyle-styled, eval = F, echo = T}
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
) 
```

For those who want the configuration to be the default, you can add a line in the `.Rprofile` file like:

```{r grkstyle-addition, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#https://github.com/gadenbuie/grkstyle
options(styler.addins_style_transformer = "grkstyle::grk_style_transformer(indent_by = 6)")
```


# [Keyboard Shortcut](#keyboard-shortcut)

Rstudio publishes a helpful "how-to-modify-a-keyboard-shortcut" [article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE). Go to Tools > Keyboard Shortcuts Help to see all of the shortcuts.  (There's a lot!)  You can create a shortcut for any Addins. The "Addins" are at the bottom of the list.

Go to Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts.  Scroll to the shortcut entitled "style active file". Click on the shortcut column and enter a memorable key combination.

```{r rstudio-keyboard-shortcut, fig.cap="Choose memorable key combination.  Here, I used \"s\" to remind me of the word \"style\"."}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio_keyboard_shortcut.png")
```


# [GitHub Workflow](#GitHub-workflow)

You can also style your code upon a push to GitHub.  A library of GitHub workflows for `R` code is maintained at [https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2).  There is a workflow [example](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2/examples/style.yaml) for styling your code with `styler`. You can also find other examples by searching for `path:.github/workflows styler`.

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Styling your code consistently is the key to programming effectively. While you don't have to follow a style guide, they contain helpful standards and accepted norms that allow others to quickly understand your program and potentially collaborate.  The `styler` and `grkstyle` packages are helpful in that they can be quickly set up to follow the tidyverse style.  A keyboard shortcut can further speed your coding.  Should you decide to set up a GitHub workflow, additional resources are available.
