summary: As a script grows in both length and complexity, it becomes difficult to see which parentheses and brackets match with one another.  Consistent styling is crucial to being able to debug problematic code.  This post offers some tips.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'blogdown',
      'styler'
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=T,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=F
)
```

```{r set-ggplot-theme-defaults, include = F}
#from ggthemes
library(ggplot2); theme_set(ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

```{r define-color-palette, include = F, eval = T}
# color blind friendly palette from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#000000")
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

# [Overview](#overview)

Interactive programming with `shiny` can result in deep nesting of code.  A closing bracket or parentheses can either be mismatched or omitted completely. The solution is to style the code consistently. Yes.

# [Background](#background)

The `styler` package in R is designed to style R code. 

```{r load-pkg, eval=FALSE}
#install package
install.packages("styler")
library(styler)
```

The package [overview](https://styler.r-lib.org/index.html) details its main functions: `style_pkg()`, `style_file()` and `style_text()`. These functions are added to the "Addins" menu in Rstudio.

```{r example-styler, echo = T}
#example
style_text("readr::read_csv('./my_table.csv',col_names=c('a','b'))")
```

The tidyverse style guide is a sensible default for writing R code.

```{r example-tidyverse-style, echo = T}
# example tidyverse style
styler::style_text("call( 1)", style = tidyverse_style, scope = "spaces")

```

Space indentation is 2 spaces for tidyverse style.  This is problematic when writing deeply nested code and fails to provide enough contrast for bracket matching.  While everyone has an opinion, my preference is for code to be written with indentation of 6 spaces.

```{r code-for-indentation, eval = F}
#indent code by six spaces
styler::style_file("./my_file.R", style = tidyverse_style(indent_by = 6))
```
