summary: By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as
  its summary and stores it into the `.Summary` page variable for use in your templates.
  You may customize the summary length by setting `summaryLength` in your site configuration
  *or* you can set it in the front matter.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## see http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/08/blogdown-archetype-template/#.YEOC-C2cZOR
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
x <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'knitcitations',
      'BiocStyle',
      'blogdown'
)
lapply(x, library, character.only = T)

## Load knitcitations with a clean bibliography
cleanbib()
cite_options(hyperlink = 'to.doc', citation_format = 'text', style = 'html')

bib <- c(
    'BiocStyle' = citation('BiocStyle'),
    'blogdown' = citation('blogdown')[2],
    'devtools' = citation('devtools'),
    'knitcitations' = citation('knitcitations')
)
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=T,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=F
)
```

```{r set-ggplot-theme-defaults, include = F}
#from ggthemes
library(ggplot2); theme_set(ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

```{r define-color-palette, include = F, eval = T}
# color blind friendly palette from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#000000")
```
You can find the full code for the archetype at my [gist](https://gist.github.com/RobWiederstein/b153a853550f42c1378569b06efd49f7). Some of the code blocks were not included via `include=F` as a quick way to silence the packages loading.

## R image


```{r plot-mtcars, echo=F, fig.cap = "A plot with 538 layout theme and color blind palette."}
data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, group = cyl, colour = cyl))
p <- p + scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette)
p <- p + geom_point(size = 2)
p <- p + ggtitle("mtcars")
p
```

## Custom image

The easiest option is to use the  `r CRANpkg('blogdown')` _Insert Image_ RStudio addin to add an external image.
