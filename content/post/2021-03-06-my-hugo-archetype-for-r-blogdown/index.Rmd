   caption: Archetype is another word for model.  It's a model to follow in drafting a blog post.
summary: An archetype is a model to follow in drafting a post.  A number of other synomyms also come to mind like form, template, outline, scaffold or layout.  An archetype is a model kept within the archetypes folder in hugo.  It's a smart way to bring consistency to your posts. Below is the archetype I use in rending an `R` analysis.

```{r load-packages, include = F}
## Load frequently used packages for blog posts
packages <- c(
      'devtools', #for session info
      'ggthemes', #for plots
      'blogdown'
)
lapply(packages, function(x) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```

```{r set-chunk-options, include = F}
## Do not break chunk line
## Do not use spaces or periods "." or underscores "_"
## set options for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = '',
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .8,
  fig.align="center",
  message=F,
  error=F,
  warning=F,
  tidy=T,
  comment='',
  cache=T,
  dev='svg',
  echo=F
)
```

```{r set-ggplot-theme-defaults, include = F}
#from ggthemes
library(ggplot2); theme_set(ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

```{r define-color-palette, include = F, eval = T}
# color blind friendly palette from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/
cbPalette <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7", "#000000")
```

```{r write-package-bib, echo = F}
# write packages used to bib in current directory
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "./packages.bib")
```

## R image


```{r plot-mtcars, echo=F, fig.cap = "A plot with 538 layout theme and color blind palette."}
data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, group = cyl, colour = cyl))
p <- p + scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette)
p <- p + geom_point(size = 2)
p <- p + ggtitle("mtcars")
p
```
