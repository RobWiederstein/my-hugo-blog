summary: Women serving on their country's highest courts are a relatively new phenomena.  The trend accelerated beginning in the 1990s and now includes countries all over the world of differing economic levels. Women impact both the process and outcome of court decisions when appointed.  Additionally, women bolster court legitmacy among marginalized and unrepresented constituencies.

# [Overview](#overview)

A dataset was released on the number of women by country serving on the highest courts.[@escobar-lemmonBreakingJudicialGlass2021] Two kinds of court structures exist.  Some countries' highest court is comprised of one court and it is often referred to as a "Supreme" court.  Examples of this court structure would include the United States.  Other countries have two high courts, comprised of a "Constitutional" court and an "Appellate" court.  This structure is prevalent in civil law countries.   In the dataset, the variable `courttype` is coded as `r unique(df.0$courttype)`.

The dataset contains two date variables.  `year` includes the years 1970 through 2013. The second variable `yearfirstwoman` is more current and includes any woman appointed to a high court as of December 31, 2020.  The co-principal investigators profiles are available [here](https://womenonhighcourts.com/researchers/) and the book "Reimagining the Judiciary: Women's Representation on High Courts Worldwide" is to be released in October 2021. More information is available, including visualizations, at [Women on high courts](https://womenonhighcourts.com).

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)

As of 2013, there were more women justices in the West, in non-OECD countries and on courts designated as "APP".  The percentage of women serving was highest in countries in the top quintile of the human development index.  More economically advanced countries were the first to begin appointing women, but over time, women in less prosperous countries have made significant advances as well.  I'm really looking forward to the release of the researchers new book and hope you'll read it too.
