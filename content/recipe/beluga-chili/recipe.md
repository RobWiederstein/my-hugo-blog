summary: The beluga lentils texture rivals that of ground beef.  Definitely, give this recipe a try for your non-vegetarian friends. (Just put a bunch of cheese and hot sauce with it and they'll never know the difference.)

# Ingredients

6 c. water
1 c. beluga lentils
1 can chili or black beans
1 can crushed tomatoes
1 pepper diced
1 onion diced
1 tbs minced garlic
1/4 cup chili powder
2 tbs cumin
Salt and Pepper


# Directions

Saute the pepper, onion and minced garlic in stock pot with an available cooking oil. Add water and bring to a boil. Next add the lentils, crushed tomatoes and seasonings.  Turn down to allow simmer for at least an hour.  Watch to see if water needs to be added.  Add chili beans once lentils are tender.

# Notes

We serve the lentil chili over tater tots.  Garnish with traditional chili fixings like shredded cheese, crackers, hot sauce and sour cream.

# Nutrition

Skip the tots and cheese if you are concerned.
