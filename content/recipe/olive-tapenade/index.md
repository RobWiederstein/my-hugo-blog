caption: Olive Tapenade with Whole Wheat Penne
summary:  Growing up, my parents used to always let me have the olive out of their martini.  Those halcyon days of yore left me yearning for some olives.  If you're looking to break out of a dull meal selection, this is a wonderful choice.  Castelano and kalmcatta olives with zesty capers, lemon juice and garlic are a feast.

# Ingredients

1 bunch curly parsley
1 lemon
4 cloves crushed garlic
1 oz. capers
6.5 oz. Greek Kalamata pitted black olives
8.0 oz. Castelvetrano pitted green olives
1 oz. olive oil
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
16 oz. box whole wheat penne pasta

# Directions

In a large stock pot, boil 3 quarts water and add penne.  Cook according to instructions and rinse under cool water.  Combine remaining ingredients in a food processor.  Chop roughly.  Combine penne and olive tapenade.  Top with parmesan.

# Notes

Read up on olives and obtain your favorites.  I could not find castelvetrano olives that were pitted from Walmart.  I ended up ordering olives from Amazon from a company called "Santini".  The olives were really mild and not at all like the cocktail olives of my youth.

# Nutrition

Olives while tasty have little nutritional value.
