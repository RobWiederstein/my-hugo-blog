summary:  I absolutely love pumpkin, but it's a little boring by itself.  This recipe has fewer calories than either pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread.  Usually, fall is the perfect time for this but we eat it all year round.

# Ingredients

 -   2 boxes Jello brand no sugar, quick set butterscotch pudding
 -   milk
 -   1 small container cool whip
 -   all spice, cinnamon, or nutmeg
 -   gingersnaps
 -   1/2 can to 2/3 of a 15 oz. can of pumpkin

# Directions

Put milk, coolwhip, pumpkin and pudding mix into large mixing bowl.  Whisk thouroughly and refridgerate for greater than 30 minutes.  When serving, garnish with sprinkle of nutmeg and some gingersnap cookies.

# Notes

If using a plant-based milk like almond milk, you'll want to reduce the amount used.  I cut mine in half. (It called for four cups and I used two cups.)

# Nutrition

For a dessert, not bad.
