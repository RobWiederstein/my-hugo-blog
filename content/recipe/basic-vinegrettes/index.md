## Ingredients
- Oil
- Vinegar
- Sugar
- Herbs and spices
- Dash of salt

## Directions

I have a little 2 cup tupperware shaker that I use.  For two to four servings, add 1/4 cup of oil, 2 tbs of vinegar, a tsp or two of sugar, and some herbs and spices.  Shake well.  You're done.

## Notes

I often use a package of sweet and low for the sweetner.  Also, I never keep any leftovers since I make so little at one time.

## Nutrition

The oil is high in fat and calories.  Use it sparingly.
