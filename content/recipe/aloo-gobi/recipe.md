# Notes

Meal was made special due to the efforts of a colleague and his mother to acquaint me with authentic Indian spices.  It was an excellent, festive night and my spouse remarked that she "could eat like this every night!"

# Nutrition

Probably pretty good since it was just vegetables and rice.
