# Ingredients

-   1 bag frozen tortellini
-   1 bag butternut squash
-   4 oz basil pesto
-   fresh and rougly chopped basil is a nice touch

# Directions

Preheat oven to 350.  Spray baking sheet or pan with vegetable oil.  (I usually cover mine in aluminum foil for easy clean up.) Bake until fork pierces squash easily but is not mushy.  Boil 4 quart water.  Salt water to taste.  When tortellini float, they are done.  Verify with package instrucions.  Drain tortellini and toss in large bowl with butternut squash and pesto.

# Notes

Garnish with parmesan cheese and a nice white wine. Pairs well with a green salad and fresh bread.

# Nutrition

Unknown, but the squash will make everybody feel better about it.
