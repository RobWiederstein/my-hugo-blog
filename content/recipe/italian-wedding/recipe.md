# Ingredients

-   1 pkg. frozen meatballs (We use meatless and they're delicious.)
-   1 pkg fresh or frozen spinach
-   1 cup small pasta (I use Israeli couscous)
-   2 tbs chicken bouillon
-   4 quarts water

# Directions

In a large stock pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil.  Add chicken boillion, 1 pkg. frozen meatballs, and pasta.  Cook according to pasta package instructions.  Three to five minutes prior to pasta being done, add spinach.  Salt and pepper liberally.

# Notes

We always use a bunch of parmesan with this soup.
