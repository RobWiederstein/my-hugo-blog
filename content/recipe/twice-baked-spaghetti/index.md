# Ingredients
-   16 oz. box of spaghetti
-   2 24 oz. jars of prepared spaghetti sauce
-   Parmesan
-   1/2 stick butter
-   3 eggs
-   1/3 cup sour cream
-   1/2 cup milk
-   2 cups shredded cheese
-   basil, oregano,  garlic

# Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9 x 13 baking dish.  Boil water and cook spaghetti according to package directions.  In large mixing bowl partially soften butter.  Add three eggs and whisk briskly.  Add sour cream, milk, basil, oregano, parmesan and garlic powder.  Place drained spaghetti in baking dish and pour mixture over the top. Add shredded cheese. Cover the top with the spaghetti layer of spaghetti sauce.  (You probably won't use both jars).  Cook for 50 minutes or until middle of casserole is firm.

# Notes

I like the thicker spaghetti, instead of angel hair or thin, for this dish.

# Nutrition

Horrible. Tell yourself that you will go to the gym the next morning.
