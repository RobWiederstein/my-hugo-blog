# Ingredients
        
-   3 15 oz. cans of navy or Cannelini beans
-   1 jar of your favorite marinara sauce
-   1 lb italian sausage or its vegetarian equivalent
-   4 slices of mozzarella cheese
-   1 cup fresh spinach

# Directions

In a 9 x 9 baking dish and after coating with vegetable spray, pour the rinsed beans into the dish.  Stir in marinara sauce sufficient to coat the beans.  Add spinach.  Slice the italian sausage and mix into the dish.  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Place mozzarella cheese on top and bake uncovered for an additional 10 minutes.

# Notes

I usually buy BelGioioso sliced fresh mozzarella.
