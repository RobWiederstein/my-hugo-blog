This is a family favorite that, unbelievalby, used to made with mayonnaise.  We buy a lot of apples that go uneaten so toward he end of the week, I often make this to get rid of the leftover apples.

# Ingredients
- 3 apples
- 1 cup vanilla low fat yogurt
- 2 stalks celery
- 1/2 c. raisins
- 1/2 c. nuts
- cinnamon

# Directions
Combine all ingredients in large bowl after dicing celery and apples.  Pour vanilla yogurt over the top and mix well. Garnish with dash of cinnamon.

# Notes

Nice way to get folks to eat celery and apples.

# Nutrition

Unknown but better than when we made it with mayonnaise!
