# Ingredients
- 1 box bowtie pasta
- 1 green pepper
- 1 onion, purple if you have it
- 1 small can black olives sliced
- 1 jar banana peppers
- 1 pkg. feta cheese
- 1/3 bottle Kraft Greek salad viniagrette

# Directions

Bring 4 quarts water to boil.  Add pasta and salt to taste.  In large mixing bowl, combine remaining ingredients after chopping onion and pepper.  Drain pasta and rinse in cold water.  Add salad dressing and mix well.

# Notes

My spouse is not a fan of feta or "stinky" cheese.  I substitute mozzarella pearls  which are the size of a small marble.
