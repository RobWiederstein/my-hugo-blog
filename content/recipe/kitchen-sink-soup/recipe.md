summary: This is called Kitchen-Sink Vegetable soup because everything is in it, including the kitchen sink.  Before going to the grocery store for the week, I clear out the vegetable bin. The wine is for me not the soup.

## Ingredients

-   8 c. water
-   2 c. salsa or 1 can crushed tomatoes
-   1 onion
-   1 celery bundle
-   Plenty of carrots
-   2 potatoes
-   Any other vegetables you can find
-   1 cup pasta or grain of your choice
-   Salt and Pepper liberally

# Directions

Fill large kitchen stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Add salsa and diced vegetables of similar size.  Reduce to simmer and cook for an hour.  Compact root vegetables  take the longest to cook.  Add potatoes about 30 minutes prior to serving because nobody likes mushy potatoes.  Finally add the pasta or grain and cook according to package instructions.  (A long grain rice will take about 25 minutes whereas pasta will take about 10 minutes. Personally, I use ditali or rotini pasta if I have it).  The key here is to dice the vegetables about equal size so they cook at about the same pace.

# Notes

Garnish with parmesan or hot sauce, crackers or cornbread.
