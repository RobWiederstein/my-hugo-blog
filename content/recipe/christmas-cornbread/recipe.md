# Ingredients

-   15 oz. can of coconut milk
-   2 eggs
-   2 box Jiffy cornbread mix
-   1 small can of green chilis
-   1 4 oz. jar of red pimentos

# Directions

Preheat oven according to instructions on box.  Spray or grease a 9 in. pie pan or baking dish.  Scramble the eggs in a large mixing bowl.  Strain extra water from pimentos and chilis.  Add remaining ingredients to the bowl and stir well.  Pour into pie pan.  Cook until knife inserted in the middle withdraws without residue.

# Notes

Coconut milk gives the cornbread a sweet but slightly different taste.  Regular dairy milk can be sustituted.

# Nutrition

It can't be good, but then again, who fixes cornbread like this, except when you're expecting company.
