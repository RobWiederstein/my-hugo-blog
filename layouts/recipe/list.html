      <p>
            Since the pandemic began in 2020, my family and I have largely been confined to the house.  Trying to make the most of it, we've put a renewed energy into meal selection and preparation.  I've also mostly converted to being a vegetarian.  In the recipes that follow, you'll notice some common themes.  First, they are **not** fancy, but some are creative.  Second, the ingredients can be bought at your local Walmart.  This is practical in that we travel to a lot of remote places, and Walmart can usually be found there.  Third, preparation is minimal and the estimated preparation time does not include the time in the oven.  Fourth, the recipes revolve around whole grains, pasta, fruits and vegetables. Finally, the amount of seasoning is omitted due to individual preferences. Enjoy.
