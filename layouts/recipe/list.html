      <p>
            Since the pandemic began in 2020, I have had to relearn to cook.  You will notice some common themes in my cooking:  my ingredients are from Walmart; to the extent that there is any "meat", it is usually meat alternatives or shellfish; the dishes are ones that my family enjoys; and preparation is almost always under 30 minutes. The specific amounts of seasonings are frequently omitted. My spouse is more taste/smell senstive than I am, so typically the dishes are less spicy, salty, etc. than I would fix for myself.  Enjoy.
