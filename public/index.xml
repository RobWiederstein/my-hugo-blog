      <description>When code starts to run into the dozens of lines, it can begin to look like a jumbled box of legos.  The parts all go together, but you can easily forget the order and the ultimate goal of the project.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a post to offer an organizational strategy for writing code in Rstudio.</description>

      <description>You can create a data dashboard in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;flexdashboard&lt;/code&gt; package. In the background, there are a handful of other packages like bootstrap, bootswatch and fontawesome. The generated website did not have a footer though.  Here is a mashup of some html and css. The code was posted in a codepen repo.</description>

      <description>Women serving on their country&amp;rsquo;s highest courts are a relatively new phenomena.  The trend accelerated beginning in the 1990s and now includes countries all over the world of differing economic levels. Women impact both the process and outcome of court decisions when appointed.  Additionally, women bolster court legitmacy among marginalized and unrepresented constituencies.</description>

      <description>4134 people were killed outside of the judicial process in the United States between 1882 and 1936.  Most of the victims were black males living in former slave states of the deep South and were killed by lynching. However, lynchings were not unique to the South and occurred in other places as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been piping code with dplyr for several years now.  But because I use it so often, I thought it was time for a refresher and some renewed investigation.  Sometimes, revisiting a topic can help break me out of a programming funk.  And sure enough, some new methods were discovered.</description>

      <description>The Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC) published data on the commercial fish catch in the Great Lakes from 1867 to 2015. Each lake is unique and its features impact what fish are present, their composition over time and the overall volume of commercial fish catch.</description>

      <description>Data can yield new insights and enrich our understanding of history.  A new book by historian Cameron Blevins takes the location of U.S. post offices from 1639 to 2000 and plots them on a map by date of their establishment. The visual display shows the expansion of the American colonies westward.</description>

      <description>Lists as a data type can be confusing but also useful.  They can hold data of different types and lengths, making them very versatile.  Lists can be named or nested and have the same or different lengths. This post deals with converting a list to a dataframe when it has unequal lengths.</description>

      <description>The Wisconsin Historical Society created a database of shipwrecks in its waters.  The shipwrecks occurred between the years 1679 and 1981.  The total number of observations with location data was 615.  A text field was included describing the cargo of the ships.  A wordcloud of the most frequently used words is created from the text field.</description>

      <description>Growing up, my parents used to always let me have the olive out of their martini.  Those halcyon days of yore left me yearning for some olives.  If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to break out of a dull meal selection, this is a wonderful choice.  Castelvetrano and kalamata olives with zesty capers, lemon juice and garlic are a feast.</description>

      <description>An archetype is a model to follow in drafting a post.  A number of other synomyms also come to mind like form, template, outline, scaffold or layout.  An archetype is a model kept within the archetypes folder in hugo.  It&amp;rsquo;s a smart way to bring consistency to your posts. Below is the archetype I use in rending an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; analysis.</description>

      <description>This is called Vegetable Medley Soup because everything is in it, including the kitchen sink.  Before going to the grocery store for the week, I clear out the vegetable bin. The wine is for me not the soup.</description>

      <description>The beluga lentils texture rivals that of ground beef.  Definitely, give this recipe a try for your non-vegetarian friends. (Just put a bunch of cheese and hot sauce with it and they&amp;rsquo;ll never know the difference.)</description>

      <description>This is a family favorite that, unbelievably, used to be made with mayonnaise.  We buy a lot of apples that go uneaten. Toward the end of the week, I often make this to get rid of the leftover apples.</description>

      <description>I’m a dad, a retired judge, a guitar player, a former state representative, an amateur programmer and statistician. Out of fear that some may take my posts too seriously, I describe myself as someone who does mostly exploratory analysis and visualization&amp;ndash;although I have ventured into predictive analytics and modeling from time to time. I&amp;rsquo;ve even participated in a couple of kaggle contests and submitted an R notebook.
The death of analytical/investigative reporting at the regional and local level is something that concerns me.</description>
