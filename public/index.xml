      <description>This is called Kitchen-Sink Vegetable soup because everything is in it, including the kitchen sink.  Before going to the grocery store for the week, I clear out the vegetable bin. The wine is for me not the soup.</description>

      <description>Load Libraries Insert Data Tables or DT Widget Insert Leaflet Widget Insert Sigma JS Insert Plotly Widget   There were two main reasons for moving to blogdown. First, I needed a blogging platform that moved seemlessly between R code and its output. It had to be easy to show the connection between the code that was used and its effect on the data.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m a dad, a retired judge, a guitar player, a former state representative, an amateur programmer and statistician. Out of fear that some may take my posts too seriously, I describe myself as someone who does mostly exploratory analysis and visualization&amp;ndash;although I have ventured into predictive analytics and modeling from time to time. I&amp;rsquo;ve even participated in a couple of kaggle contests and submitted an R notebook.
The death of analytical/investigative reporting at the regional and local level is something that concerns me.</description>
