      <description>Growing up, my parents used to always let me have the olive out of their martini.  Those halcyon days of yore left me yearning for some olives.  If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to break out of a dull meal selection, this is a wonderful choice.  Castelvetrano and kalamata olives with zesty capers, lemon juice and garlic are a feast.</description>

      <description>Everytime I run into a file with an &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; extension, I cringe.  Though, admittedly, it&amp;rsquo;s a file format that you have to be familiar with when it comes to sending and receiving data over the web. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has a package &lt;code&gt;xlm2&lt;/code&gt; to assist in the conversion of nested data to tabular data.</description>

      <description>I absolutely love pumpkin, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little boring by itself.  This recipe has fewer calories than either pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread.  Usually, fall is the perfect time for this but we eat it all year round.</description>

      <description>This is a meal for any time of day.  The yellow yolks contrast from the bright green brussel sprouts and a dash of cayenne pepper give it a culinary kick. This was the specialty of one of our favorite local restaurants.</description>

      <description>This is called Vegetable Medley Soup because everything is in it, including the kitchen sink.  Before going to the grocery store for the week, I clear out the vegetable bin. The wine is for me not the soup.</description>

      <description>Load Libraries Insert Data Tables or DT Widget Insert Leaflet Widget Insert Sigma JS Insert Plotly Widget   There were two main reasons for moving to blogdown. First, I needed a blogging platform that moved seemlessly between R code and its output. It had to be easy to show the connection between the code that was used and its effect on the data.</description>

      <description>The beluga lentils texture rivals that of ground beef.  Definitely, give this recipe a try for your non-vegetarian friends. (Just put a bunch of cheese and hot sauce with it and they&amp;rsquo;ll never know the difference.)</description>

      <description>I’m a dad, a retired judge, a guitar player, a former state representative, an amateur programmer and statistician. Out of fear that some may take my posts too seriously, I describe myself as someone who does mostly exploratory analysis and visualization&amp;ndash;although I have ventured into predictive analytics and modeling from time to time. I&amp;rsquo;ve even participated in a couple of kaggle contests and submitted an R notebook.
The death of analytical/investigative reporting at the regional and local level is something that concerns me.</description>
