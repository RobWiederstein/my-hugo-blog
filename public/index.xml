      <description>Load Libraries Insert Data Tables or DT Widget Insert Leaflet Widget Insert Sigma JS Insert Plotly Widget   There were two main reasons for moving to blogdown.

      <description>Iâ€™m a dad, a retired judge, a guitar player, a former state representative, an amateur programmer and statistician. Out of fear that some may take my posts too seriously, I describe myself as someone who does mostly exploratory analysis and visualization&amp;ndash;although I have ventured into predictive analytics and modeling from time to time. I&amp;rsquo;ve even participated in a couple of kaggle contests and submitted an R notebook.
The death of analytical/investigative reporting at the regional and local level is something that concerns me.</description>
