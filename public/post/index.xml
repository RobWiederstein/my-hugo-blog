      <description>By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as its summary and stores it into the &lt;code&gt;.Summary&lt;/code&gt; page variable for use in your templates. You may customize the summary length by setting &lt;code&gt;summaryLength&lt;/code&gt; in your site configuration &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; you can set it in the front matter.</description>

      <description>Data is sometimes stored as an Excel spreadsheet.  To work with it in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, it must be imported using a package. This project imports an excel spreadsheet of Freddie Mac mortgage rates using the &lt;code&gt;rio&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;readxl&lt;/code&gt; packages.</description>

      <description>With the ubiquitous &amp;ldquo;FIPS&amp;rdquo; codes, there is no consistency in how they are formatted.  It seems like on every project, the merge is dependent upon the format matching in the datasets and then I&amp;rsquo;ve usually got a mess on my hands.  A missing &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; is often the problem.</description>

      <description>When code starts to run into the dozens of lines, it can begin to look like a jumbled box of legos.  The parts all go together, but you can easily forget the order and the ultimate goal of the project.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a post to offer an organizational strategy for writing code in Rstudio.</description>

      <description>You can create a data dashboard in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;flexdashboard&lt;/code&gt; package. In the background, there are a handful of other packages like bootstrap, bootswatch and fontawesome. The generated website did not have a footer though.  Here is a mashup of some html and css. The code was posted in a codepen repo.</description>

      <description>Women serving on their country&amp;rsquo;s highest courts are a relatively new phenomena.  The trend accelerated beginning in the 1990s and now includes countries all over the world of differing economic levels. Women impact both the process and outcome of court decisions when appointed.  Additionally, women bolster court legitmacy among marginalized and unrepresented constituencies.</description>

      <description>4134 people were killed outside of the judicial process in the United States between 1882 and 1936.  Most of the victims were black males living in former slave states of the deep South and were killed by lynching. However, lynchings were not unique to the South and occurred in other places as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been piping code with dplyr for several years now.  But because I use it so often, I thought it was time for a refresher and some renewed investigation.  Sometimes, revisiting a topic can help break me out of a programming funk.  And sure enough, some new methods were discovered.</description>

      <description>Data can yield new insights and enrich our understanding of history.  A new book by historian Cameron Blevins takes the location of U.S. post offices from 1639 to 2000 and plots them on a map by date of their establishment. The visual display shows the expansion of the American colonies westward.</description>

      <description>Lists as a data type can be confusing but also useful.  They can hold data of different types and lengths, making them very versatile.
