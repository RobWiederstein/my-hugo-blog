      <description>The Wisconsin Historical Society created a database of shipwrecks in its waters.  The shipwrecks occurred between the years 1679 and 1981.  The total number of observations with location data was 615.  A text field was included describing the cargo of the ships.  A wordcloud of the most frequently used words is created from the text field.</description>

      <description>An archetype is a model to follow in drafting a post.  A number of other synomyms also come to mind like form, template, outline, scaffold or layout.  An archetype is a model kept within the archetypes folder in hugo.  It&amp;rsquo;s a smart way to bring consistency to your posts. Below is the archetype I use in rending an &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; analysis.</description>

      <description>Everytime I run into a file with an &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; extension, I cringe.  Though, admittedly, it&amp;rsquo;s a file format that you have to be familiar with when it comes to sending and receiving data over the web. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has a package &lt;code&gt;xlm2&lt;/code&gt; to assist in the conversion of nested data to tabular data.</description>

      <description>Blogdown &amp;amp; Hugo allow for the insertion of html widgets like leaflet. This is a huge time saver because one doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to learn java and can instead stay within the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; environment.</description>
