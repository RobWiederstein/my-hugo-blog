      <description>This post uses the United States Coast Guard data to plot navigation aides.  Many observations were dropped for incomplete data, but those with a dwelling were colored differently.  Buoys were omitted too.</description>

      <description>By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as its summary and stores it into the &lt;code&gt;.Summary&lt;/code&gt; page variable for use in your templates. You may customize the summary length by setting &lt;code&gt;summaryLength&lt;/code&gt; in your site configuration &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; you can set it in the front matter.</description>

      <description>Everytime I run into a file with an &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; extension, I cringe.  Though, admittedly, it&amp;rsquo;s a file format that you have to be familiar with when it comes to sending and receiving data over the web. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has a package &lt;code&gt;xlm2&lt;/code&gt; to assist in the conversion of nested data to tabular data.</description>

      <description>Load Libraries Insert Data Tables or DT Widget Insert Leaflet Widget Insert Sigma JS Insert Plotly Widget   There were two main reasons for moving to blogdown.

It had to be easy to show the connection between the code that was used and its effect on the data.</description>
