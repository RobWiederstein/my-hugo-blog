      <description>The Wisconsin Historical Society created a database of shipwrecks in its waters.  The shipwrecks occurred between the years 1679 and 1981.  The total number of observations with location data was 615.  A text field was included describing the cargo of the ships.  A wordcloud of the most frequently used words is created from the text field.</description>

      <description>This post uses the United States Coast Guard data to plot navigation aides.  Many observations were dropped for incomplete data, but those with a dwelling were colored differently.  Buoys were omitted too.</description>

      <description>By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as its summary and stores it into the &lt;code&gt;.Summary&lt;/code&gt; page variable for use in your templates. You may customize the summary length by setting &lt;code&gt;summaryLength&lt;/code&gt; in your site configuration &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; you can set it in the front matter.</description>

      <description>Everytime I run into a file with an &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; extension, I cringe.  Though, admittedly, it&amp;rsquo;s a file format that you have to be familiar with when it comes to sending and receiving data over the web. &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has a package &lt;code&gt;xlm2&lt;/code&gt; to assist in the conversion of nested data to tabular data.</description>

      <description>Blogdown &amp;amp; Hugo allow for the insertion of html widgets like leaflet. This is a huge time saver because one doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to learn java and can instead stay within the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; environment.</description>
